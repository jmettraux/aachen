[SWN SRD question](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWN/comments/jxlw1e/swn_srd_a_quick_question_for_kevin_plus_what_do/)

> A setting-neutral SRD isn't really worth it, since there's nothing

> I don't have any issues with people copying mechanics because it would be
> ridiculous for me to have such reservations. I lifted mechanics from prior
> innovators to support my efforts, and it's only fair and reasonable that
> others should be able to do the same with my work. If someone wants to loot
> SWN's rules wholesale and build a cyberpunk game around them, or a fantasy
> game, or a different sci-fi game, well, that's entirely reasonable. So long
> as "Stars Without Number" isn't in the actual product title and it isn't
> presented as "official" content, it's wholly fair to advertise it explicitly
> as being SWN-compatible.

> galactic catastrophes, sclerotic empires, laser pistols that do 1d6 damage,
> or other trope mainstays are hardly my property, and there's nothing stopping
> someone from making their own setting with the same general outlines.
