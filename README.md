> A setting-neutral SRD isn't really worth it, since there's nothing

> can already copy every mechanic in SWN in their own words and release it as
> their own game. At most, the SRD would let them just copy certain text
> wholesale, but that's not going to sell too well when all that text is
> already free.

> I don't have any issues with people copying mechanics because it would be
> ridiculous for me to have such reservations. I lifted mechanics from prior
> innovators to support my efforts, and it's only fair and reasonable that
> others should be able to do the same with my work. If someone wants to loot
> SWN's rules wholesale and build a cyberpunk game around them, or a fantasy
> game, or a different sci-fi game, well, that's entirely reasonable. So long
> as "Stars Without Number" isn't in the actual product title and it isn't
> presented as "official" content, it's wholly fair to advertise it explicitly
> as being SWN-compatible.

> I keep a hold on the actual setting IP because that is something that's
> uniquely mine, and if I don't defend it I'll lose it. But generic concepts of
> galactic catastrophes, sclerotic empires, laser pistols that do 1d6 damage,
> or other trope mainstays are hardly my property, and there's nothing stopping
> someone from making their own setting with the same general outlines.
