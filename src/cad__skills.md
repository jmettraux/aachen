The character background yields skill levels through rolls or selection.

The first time a skill is yielded, it is set at level 0. Should it come up again, it will reach level 1. At character creation the maximum level for a skill is 1, if the skill is yold again, give the level to another skill.

FIXME

Non-combat skill checks are done with 2d6; the modifier for a no-level skill is -1. Combat skill checks are different, they are done with 1d20; the modifier for a no-level skill is -2.
