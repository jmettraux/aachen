Adventurers tend to face dangers of innumerable varieties.

A **saving throw** is a chance a creature has to avoid some particularly grim outcome.

To make a saving throw, the subject rolls a d20. It is a success if the die result is higher or equal than the relevant saving throw score.

There are four kinds of saving throws.

**Evasion saves** are made to dodge hurled perils, take cover from explosions, pull back from sudden pits, and face other challenges of nimbleness and reaction speed. Evasion saves for PCs are equal to sixteen minus the character level and minus the best of their INT or DEX attribute modifiers. Thus, a third-level character with an INT modifier of +1 and a DEX modifier of -1 would have an Evasion save of 12.

**Mental saves** are made to resist mind-affecting magic, disbelieve illusions, throw off intangible magical affections, and other tests of willpower or force of character. Mental saves for PCs are equal to sixteen minus the best of their WIS or CHA attribute modifiers.

**Physical saves** are made to resist poisons, diseases, exhaustion, bodily transformation, or other taxes on the subject's physical strength. Physical saves for PCs are equal to sixteen minus the character's level and minus the best of their STR or CON modifiers.

**Luck saves** are for occasions of blind random fortune, where no quality of personal strength or cunning can help the character. The referee might call for a Luck save when it really is nothing but sheer good luck that a character might avoid some danger. Luck saves for a PC are equal to sixteen minus the character's level, unmodified by any attribute.

Note that saving are meant to be last-ditch chances to avoid the worst of unusual perils or uncommon dangers. You can't make an Evasion saving throw to dodge a sword stroke; that's what the hit roll is for. It's up to the referee to decide whether a particular danger might allow a saving throw or not.


## monsters and saving throws

Monsters, NPCs, and other creatures that are not PCs don't bother with four different saving throws. Instead they just have a single save equal to 15 minus half their hit dice, rounded down. Thus, a peasant with one hit die would have to roll 15 or better to make a saving throw against something, while a slavering hell-beast with 14 hit dice would only need to roll 8 or better to succeed.

Some monsters might have particular bonuses against certain kinds of effects or perils, and the referee might decide to give some exceptional humans a boost based on their possession of unusual quickness or bodily fortitude.
