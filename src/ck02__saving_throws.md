# saving throws

A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to resist magic, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. Referees request saving throws from characters under an imminent threat or resisting an effect.

A saving throw is done with a d20. It succeeds if equal or greater than the saving throw score.

A successful saving throw means that the character suffers no harm, or reduced harm.

Saving throws are computed from 16 minus the best of two attribute modifiers minus the character level.

## the saves

The saving throws are:

* Physical (Resistance) Save
* Mental (Resistance) Save
* Evasion ( / Dodge) Save
* (Sheer) Luck Save

### physical saves

A physical resistance save. The referee may request a physical saving throw to determine how a character resists a poison, a disease, or exhaustion.

Physical saves are equal to 16, minus the best of the STR and the CON modifiers, minus the character level.

### mental saves

A mental resistance save. The referee may request mental saving throws against magical effect, illusions, or to ward off tempations and ascertain a character's willpower.

Mental saves are equal to 16, minus the best of the WIS and the CHA modifiers, minus the character level.

### evasion saves

An evasion save. Diving and dodging from sudden explosions, pits, and perils, when swiftness and reaction speed are challenged.

Evasion saves are equal to 16, minus the best of the INT and the DEX modifiers, minus the character level.

### luck saves

Luck saves are not rooted in any attribute. When sheer good luck is the last ditch defense.

Luck saves are equal to 16, minus the character level.

## monsters and saving throws

Monsters have a single save equal to 15 minues half their hit dice, rounded down.

A 1 hit die NPC would thus save at 15, while a dragon with 14 hit dice would save at 8 or better on its d20.

## probabilities

TODO explain table below

| level |    | -2  |    | -1  |    |  0  |    |  1  |    |  2  |
|------:|---:|:---:|---:|:---:|---:|:---:|---:|:---:|---:|:---:|
|     1 | 17 | 20% | 16 | 25% | 15 | 30% | 14 | 35% | 13 | 40% |
|     2 | 16 | 25% | 15 | 30% | 14 | 35% | 13 | 40% | 12 | 45% |
|     3 | 15 | 30% | 14 | 35% | 13 | 40% | 12 | 45% | 11 | 50% |
|     4 | 14 | 35% | 13 | 40% | 12 | 45% | 11 | 50% | 10 | 55% |
|     5 | 13 | 40% | 12 | 45% | 11 | 50% | 10 | 55% |  9 | 60% |
|     6 | 12 | 45% | 11 | 50% | 10 | 55% |  9 | 60% |  8 | 65% |
|     7 | 11 | 50% | 10 | 55% |  9 | 60% |  8 | 65% |  7 | 70% |
|     8 | 10 | 55% |  9 | 60% |  8 | 65% |  7 | 70% |  6 | 75% |
|     9 |  9 | 60% |  8 | 65% |  7 | 70% |  6 | 75% |  5 | 80% |
|    10 |  8 | 65% |  7 | 70% |  6 | 75% |  5 | 80% |  4 | 85% |

For example, a character of level 3 with a DEX modifier of +2 has to roll 11 or better on a d20 to avoid falling in a suddenly spotted pit, that's 50%.
