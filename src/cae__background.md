This the background list for a simple medieval setting.[^1]

[^1]:
  One can roll, pick, or make a background with the referee's permission.

One can roll on the below Backround table. The d6 doesn't map to the whole population. It maps to the adventurer population.

If one doesn't find any suitable background, one can come up with a background description and three skills for it.

## Picking A Background

Picking a background grants a _free skill_ to the character. For example, a free man is given the _Work_ skill (at level 0).

A character may choose one of three ways of selecting skills. _go quick_, _learn two skills_, or _roll three times_.

Go Quick
: The character is granted the two _quick skills_. Done.

Learn Two Skills
: The character is granted two skills selected from the 7 skills listed under the _Learning_ column.

Roll Three Times[^2]
: Dice are rolled three times. The rolls can be made against the _Growth_ or the _Learning_ table. Rolling on the Growth table may even yield an attribute +2. Hitting _Any Skill_ gives the opportunity to choose any skill.

[^2]:
  The setting or the referee may dictate that selecting a skill like _Magic_ or _Pray_ is off limits.

* `Any Combat` grants a level in any of the combat skills: _stab_, _shoot_, or _punch_.
* `+1 Any Att` means one point can be added to any attribute score.
* `+2 Physical` means two points can be added to one (+2) or two (each +1) physical attributes (usually STR, DEX, or CON).
* `+2 Mental` means two points can be added to one (+2) or two (each +1) mental attributes (usually INT, WIS, or CHA).

Remember to recompute the attribute modifiers and the saving throw scores if an attribute score is changed.
