# Determine Background

| d6 | Background |
|---:|:----------:|
|  1 | Wanderer   |
|  2 | Slave      |
|  3 | Commoner   |
|  4 | Artisan    |
|  5 | Religious  |
|  6 | Noble      |

This the background list for a simple medieval setting.

One can roll on the below Background table. The d6 doesn't map to the whole population. It maps to the adventurer population.

A background doesn't map 1 to 1 with a social class. A character with a `religious` background might come from a commoner family or from a noble family.

If one doesn't find any suitable background, one can come up with a background description and three skills for it.


## Applying A Background

A background grants a _free skill_ to the character. For example, a `commoner` is given the _Work_ skill (at level 0).[^1]

A character may choose one of three ways of selecting skills. _go quick_, _learn two skills_, or _roll three times_.

[^1]:
  One can roll, pick, or make a background with the referee's permission.

Go Quick
: The character is granted the two _quick skills_. Done.

Learn Two Skills
: The character is granted two skills selected from the 7 skills listed under the _Learning_ column.

Roll Three Times
: Dice are rolled three times. The rolls can be made against the _Growth_ or the _Learning_ table. Rolling on the Growth table may even yield an attribute +2. Hitting _Any Skill_ gives the opportunity to choose any skill.[^2]

[^2]:
  The setting or the referee may dictate that selecting a skill like _Cast_ or _Pray_ is off limits.

* `Any Combat` grants a level in any of the combat skills: _stab_, _shoot_, or _punch_.
* `+1 Any Att` means one point can be added to any attribute score.
* `+2 Physical` means two points can be added to one (`+2`) or two (each `+1`) physical attributes (usually `STR`, `DEX`, or `CON`).
* `+2 Mental` means two points can be added to one (`+2`) or two (each `+1`) mental attributes (usually `INT`, `WIS`, or `CHA`).

Remember to recompute the attribute modifiers and the saving throw scores if an attribute score is changed.
