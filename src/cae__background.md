# Determine Background

<!-- .backgrounds.quarter-right.compact -->
| d6 | Background |
|---:|:----------:|
|  1 | Wanderer   |
|  2 | Slave      |
|  3 | Commoner   |
|  4 | Artisan    |
|  5 | Religious  |
|  6 | Noble      |

A background corresponds to where/how the character was raised. There isn't a one to one mapping between social class and background. A wanderer character may be of noble origin, but since they spent their childhood wandering, their skillset is given by the `wanderer` background.

Aachen targets Europa between 700 and 1100 AD. The Empire receded in far Byzantium, counts are still appointed officials but they try to make their officie hereditary, feodality is not far. A free man is expected to fight for his community but many are happy to pay for others to fight. The time period is wide and shifting, known yet foreign and dark.

[^1]

The background is determined by rolling 1d6, or by choosing one in accord with the referee. A player may also want to come up with their own background, giving it a name and three skills. For example, a `Mountebank` background that grants _Convince_, _Exert_, and _Perform_.


## Applying the Background

There are three ways to apply a background table.

The **quick way** is to take the _Free Skill_ and the 2 _Quick Skills_.

The **selection way** is to take the _Free Skill_ and then select two skills from the right-most column, the _Learning_ column. Disregard, _Any Skill_ and _Any Combat Skill_.

The **random way** is to the the _Free Skill_ and then roll thrice, either from the _Growth_ column or from the _Learning_ column. It is not necessary to roll thrice from the same column.

[^2]

Rolling _Any Skill_ means the player may choose any one skill for his character. Rolling _Any Combat (Skill)_ means the player may choose `SLASH`, `SHOOT`, or `PUNCH`.

Rolling _+1 Any Att_ means 1 point may be added to the score of any attribute. Rolling _+2 Physical_ means 2 points may be added to the score of `STR`, `DEX`, or `CON`. 2 points on one of them, or 1 point on two of them. Rolling _+2 Mental_ is the equivalent for `INT`, `WIS`, and `CHA`.
Remember to recompute the attribute modifiers and the saving throw scores if an attribute score is changed.

When a character is given a skill, it sets it at level 0. Taking it a second time sets it at level 1. A new character may not exceed level 1 in a skill. Should that happen, shift the increment to another skill.
