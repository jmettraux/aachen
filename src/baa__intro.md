Ability TC
: 21 - Ability `OC`, for example `STR TC` = 21 - `STR OC`

Advantage
: The referee might grant advantage on check, roll 2d20 instead of 1 and keep the highest.

Armor Class (AC)
: Base armor class + the best of _Dodge_, or the skill for the melee weapon currently in hand

Armor Class (AC) with shield
: Base armor class + the best of _Dodge_, _Shields_, or the skill for the melee weapon currently in hand

Attack Check
: 1d20 + _weapon skill_ ≥ Opponent's `AC`

Background
: Where a character is raised (not necessarily their social class)

Check
: A 1d20 + _skill_ roll to determine the outcome of an action

Class
: Most people are `fighter`s, some are `Dabster`s. Some are `Caster`s, in secret.

Difficulty Class (DC)
: The number that has to be reached with 1d20 + _skill_ when rolling for an attack check, a skill check, or a save check. FIXME

Disadvantage
: Like the _Advantage_, but keep the lowest of the 2d20.

Target Class (TC)
: An ability `TC` is equal to 21 - the ability score;
: A "save" `TC` is the mean (rounded down) of two or three ability `TC`s;
: Skill checks are usually 1d20 + _skill_ ≥ `TC`;
: For example, the referee might demand 1d20 + _Exert_ ≥ `Strength TC` to break some tool.

Trait
: A small "exception" granted to the character to denote their side talent or specialization.
