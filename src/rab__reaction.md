# Reaction Rolls and Parley

A reaction roll determines the reaction of another party upon meeting the player characters.

That other party may be a single creature or a group of them.

A referee may choose to bypass the reaction roll if he judges the situation doesn't call for it. The other party might be ambushing the player characters.
Players might throw aside a reaction roll by deciding to attack.

The reaction is determined by rolling 2d6 and consulting the table below.

If a character leads and greets the other party, add the character's CHA modifier to the reaction roll.

| 2d6     | Reaction                                           |
|:-------:|----------------------------------------------------|
|    -  2 | Hostile, attacks if the situation allows it        |
|  3 -  5 | Unfriendly, may hinder, harm, or be of little help |
|  6 -  8 | Wary, neutral                                      |
|  9 - 11 | Indifferent, uninterested                          |
| 12 -    | Friendly, helpful                                  |

The higher the roll, the friendlier the disposition.

A reaction roll is done against a background situation. A roll of 12 for a band of thugs that encircled the party might indicate they're willing to let them go for a simple bribe, not that they're throwing themselves in the arms of the player characters and declaring eternal friendship.

A high reaction roll combined with some caution on the part of the player characters might turn the combat into a parley and potentially avoid fight altogether.

Reaction rolls may be used for social encounters as well. The player characters might be presenting a request to a local magistrate and the referee rolls 2d6 plus the party leader's CHA modifier to get a feel for the magistrate mood.
