```
L      S         D
Liber  Solidus   Denarius
Livre  Sou       Denier
Pound  Shilling  Pence

( 1L = 60S / 1S = 4D / 1L = 60 * 4D = 240D )

1L = 20S
1S = 12D
1L = 20 * 12D = 240D

* 2H: Two Handed.
* L: Long, allows melee attacks up to 10 feet, even if an ally is in the way. An opponent between 5 to 10 feet can disengage freely from the L weapon wielder, no need for a _fighting withdrawal_.
* LL: Less Lethal, opponents brought to zero HP may be left alive (not mortally wounded), at the wielder's discretion.
* XA: when used for an eXecution Attack, a -1 penalty is applied to the target Physical Save and the damage is doubled.
* R: Reload. Takes a _Move Action_ to reload. If the user has at least Shoot 1 skill, only an _On Turn Action_ is necessary.
* SR: Slow Reload. Takes a _Main Action_ to reload.
* T: Throwable. Can be used in melee and also throw at the listed range. No shock damage when thrown. -4 to the hit roll if throwing while in melee with an opponent.
