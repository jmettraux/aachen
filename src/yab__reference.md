# System Quick Reference

TODO fit on one or two (facing) pages

## Skill Checks

* Roll 2d6 + the skill level + most relevant attribute modifier
* The easiest checks are difficulty 6, most are 8+, the most difficult are 12+
* Without even level-0 skill, take a -1 penalty, if the skill can be attempted at all by the totally untrained
* Bad or good circumstances or tools can apply up to a -2 to +2 penalty or bonus to the roll
* Allies can aid with their own skill use at the same difficulty, granting a +1 bonus if any helper succeeds

## Saving Throws

* Roll 1d20 and equal or exceed the saving throw score to succeed
* Roll Physical saves against poison or bodily stresses
* Roll Evasion saves against perils one can dodge or duck
* Roll Mental saves against mental or intagible magic
* Roll Luck against things only blind luck can forfend
* Monsters and NPCs have a single saving throw of 15 minus their halved and rounded-down hit dice
* A roll of 1 is always a failure, a roll of 20 is always a success

## Spellcasting

TODO

## Injury And Healing

* A creature dies or is mortally wounded at zero hit points
* Minor NPCs, PCs with the Frail quality, or creatures hit by unsurvivable injuries die instantly
* Others are mortally wounded and die six rounds later
* An ally can stabilise the mortally wounded with a DEX/Heal or an INT/Heal check at a difficulty of 8 plus the number of full rounds since the wounded was felled
* Stabilised creatures stop dying and revive in ten minutes with one hit point and the Frail quality
* Creatures lose the Frail quality after magical healing or a week of bed rest
* Magical healing stabilises and revives a Mortally Wounded PC, the frail quality is not applied

## Reaction Checks

TODO

## Combat Rounds

* A combat round lasts about six seconds
* At the start of combat, each side rolls initiative once on 1d8 and adds the best DEX modifier on their side. The highest-rolling group goes first; ties go to the PCs.
* At the referee's discretion, each individual combatant can roll initiative and then everyone acts in descending order
* On their turn in the round, a creature can take one Main Action, one Move Action, and as many On Turn or Instant actions as the referee thinks reasonable
* Main Actions are attacks, spellcasting, or other activities that would eat up most of six seconds
* Move actions allow the PC to move 30 feet or do similar short, simple actions
* On Turn actions allow the PC to say a few words, drop prone, or do other reflexively simple things
* Instant Actions can be take at any time, even during someone else's turn, or even after dice have been rolled. Instant actions are usually special powers the PC can use or the result of holding an action in combat

## Hitting And Damage

* An attack is made with a hit roll of 1d20 plus the relevant weapon skill plus the attribute modifier that the weapon uses plus the attack bonus of the character
* If the resultant roll is equal or higher than the target's Armor Class, the attack hits
* A roll of 1 before modifiers and bonuses always misses. A roll of 20 before modifiers and bonuses always hits
* On a hit, the attacker rolls the weapon's damage die and adds their relevant attribute modifier. That much damage is done to the target's hit points
* Weapons that use the Punch skill can also add the wielder's Punch skill to the damage total
* On a miss, melee attacks may do Shock damage. If the target's armor class is less than or equal to the weapon's Shock value, the Shock damage is applied. Thus a weapon with "Shock 2/13" does 2 points of damage does 2 points of damage on a miss to a target with an AC of 13 or less
* The wielders's attribute modifier and any other damage bonuses that would apply are also applied to Shock damage
* Shields negate the first instance of Shock that a target would take each round. The Total Defense action makes the target immune to Shock for the rest of the round
* A successful hit can't do less damage than the weapon's Shock would do on a miss

## Morale Checks

* a Morale check is rolled on 2d6. If it's higher than the target's Morale score, they rout, retreat, or surrender, depending on the situation and their overall discipline
* PCs never check Morale. NPCs do so when an ally first is downed, when half of them are down, or when shaken by some great reverse or terrifying foe
* Even on a successful Morale check, NPCs will not continue to fight when it is obviously futile or not worth the risk
