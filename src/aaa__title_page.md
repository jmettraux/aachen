# ${NAME_UPCASE}

${NAME_CAP} is a set of tabletop role playing rules targetting a low-fantasy Europe between the Dark Ages and AD 1100.

It's taking inspiration from Gallant & Bold by John Grümph and Stars Without Number by Kevin Crawford.

Design Decisions:

* fast character creation
* low on math (slightly harder operations only at character creation)
* may use any B/X bestiary (HD, AC, ...)
* abilities are nouns, skills are verbs, traits are adjective
* abilities and saves are DCs (TCs), skills are modifiers, d20 roll high
* traits should be short and unambiguous (-, very, extremely)
* 1d20 + modifier ≥ TC, advantage and disadvantage
* few to zero exceptions, if possible introduced by traits
* non-scholarly magic system, easily replaceable though
* linear character advancement
* nature : abilities, culture : skills
