<!-- RETURN -->

* `DC`s are either `TC`s (target class) when challenging oneself or `DC`s when being challenged
* `DC`s are computed from abilities and derived means of abilities (for example `Body TC` is the mean of `STR TC`, `CON TC`, and `DEX TC`
* linear character advancement
* non-scholarly magic system, easily replaceable though
