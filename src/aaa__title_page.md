# ${NAME_UPCASE}

${NAME_CAP} is a set of tabletop role playing rules.

It's taking inspiration from Gallant & Bold by John Grümph and Stars Without Number by Kevin Crawford.

Design Decisions:

* targets a low-fantasy Europe between the Dark Ages and AD 1100 (or a similar world of your conception)
* low on math (additions, arithmetic means, subtractions)
* may leverage any B/X bestiary (HD, AC, ...)
* abilities are nouns, skills are verbs, traits are adjective
* abilities are the six well-known abilities of old
* skills are more like skill domains, they are learned with a master usually
* traits are short qualifier available in three levels (default, _very_, and _extremly_)
* traits bring in "exceptions"
* all checks are 1d20 + _skill_ ≥ `DC`
* `DC`s are either `TC`s (target class) when challenging oneself or `DC`s when being challenged
* `DC`s are computed from abilities and derived means of abilities (for example `Body TC` is the mean of `STR TC`, `CON TC`, and `DEX TC`
* skills are nurture, while abilities and `DC`s are nature
* linear character advancement
* non-scholarly magic system, easily replaceable though
