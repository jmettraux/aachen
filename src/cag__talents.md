# Choose Talent

Once a character has a class, their Talents can be chosen. They are special knacks or focuses that the character developed.

Each Talent generally comes in two levels; the first time it is picked, it yields the first level, and the second time one gains the second level.

Once a Talent has been brought up to its maximum level, it generally can't be picked again. Some Talents can be taken more than once to apply to different skills, such as taking _Specialist_ twice to apply to both Sneak and Know skills.

Many Talents grant a bonus skill. This skill is gained at level 0 or at level 1 if already at level 0. If it's already at level 1, one has to pick any other skill expect Cast. A talent earned later on as part of character advancement may improve the skill above level 1, as explained in the character advancement rules.

Every PC can pick one Talent of any kind representing past experiences or native talent. This free talent doesn't necessarily have to have anything to do with the character class; a Fighter might be exceptionally _Cultured_, while a Weaver might be a vicious knife fighter with the _Close Combatant_ Talent.

Aside from the free Talent common to all characters, the Fighter or partial Fighter can choose one Talent related to their martial background, and an Expert or partial Expert can choose one Talent related to something other than combat. In ambiguous cases, the referee decides if the Talent really does relate to their class; some Talents might be usable for both.


## Watchful

Keenly aware of his surroundings and virtually impossible to take unaware. If the referee rolls initiative by side rather than individually, the Watchful character still rolls separately and might act alone before the rest of the group.

Never reacts more slowly than the rest of the party, regardless of roll.

Level 1
: Gains Notice as a bonus skill. Cannot be surprised. Roll two dice for initiative and take the best, or add +1 to the group initiative roll.

Level 2
: Always acts first in a combat round unless someone else involved also has Watchful.
