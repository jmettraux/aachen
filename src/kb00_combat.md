## sides

A combat usually involves two sides, the player characters and their allies' side and the opposing side.

## rounds

A combat situation is divided in **rounds** of roughly six seconds. Every participant takes their turn during the round, then another round begins.

## surprise

Attackers always try to achieve surprise.

To determine if a side surprise the other, an opposed roll DEX/Sneak versus WIS/Notice can be used. If the attackers DEX/Sneak roll prevails, they get a full round of action to themselves. Initiative is rolled when this surprise round ends.

If a group of undisciplined and/or poorly trained non-player characters is surprised, the referee might make a Morale check for them.

## initiative

The player character side throws 1d8 and adds the best DEX modifier found among them to the result. The opposing side does the same. The side with the highest result goes first. In case of tie, the player character side goes first.

Each side then lets act its members in any order they like. Once they have all had their turn, the other side starts acting. When both side have acted for the round, the next round begins, again starting with the side that initially won the initiative.

**Option:** Each player character rolls for their own initiative, 1d8 + DEX modifier. The referee rolls once for the opposing side. Advantage: it's not all or nothing, one or more player character may act before the opposing side. Disadvantage: order of action is not group decided, but dice decided, potentially hindering group tactics.
