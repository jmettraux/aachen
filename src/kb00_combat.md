## sides

A combat usually involves two sides, the player characters and their allies' side and the opposing side.

## rounds

A combat situation is divided in **rounds** of roughly six seconds. Every participant takes their turn during the round, then another round begins.

1. reaction roll if necessary
2. surprise round if necessary
3. initiative roll
4. round begins
  * initiative side takes their turns
  * other side takes their turns
  * go to 4, next round begins

## surprise

Attackers always try to achieve surprise.

To determine if a side surprise the other, an opposed roll DEX/Sneak versus WIS/Notice can be used. If the attackers DEX/Sneak roll prevails, they get a full round of action to themselves. Initiative is rolled when this surprise round ends.

If a group of undisciplined and/or poorly trained non-player characters is surprised, the referee might make a Morale check for them.

## initiative

The player character side throws 1d8 and adds the best DEX modifier found among them to the result. The opposing side does the same. The side with the highest result goes first. In case of tie, the player character side goes first.

Each side then lets act its members in any order they like. Once they have all had their turn, the other side starts acting. When both side have acted for the round, the next round begins, again starting with the side that initially won the initiative.

**Option:** Each player character rolls for their own initiative, 1d8 + DEX modifier. The referee rolls once for the opposing side. Advantage: it's not all or nothing, one or more player character may act before the opposing side. Disadvantage: order of action is not group decided, but dice decided, potentially hindering group tactics.

## action types

When it's their turn, a participant may perform one **main action** and one **move action**, in the order they deem appropriate.

There are also **on turn actions** and **instant actions**. Once the 4 types of actions are described, specialized actions will be described and each mapped to one type of action.

### main actions

A **main action** takes up most of the participant's round. Attacking an adversary, casting a spell, drawing a downed ally into cover, are examples of main actions.

A participant may decide to turn their **main action** into a **move action**, effectively benefitting from two **move actions** for their round.

### move actions

The participant may move from zero to their normal movement rate, for a human participant, that's from 0 to 30 feet. Given the terrain and/or the circumstance the referee might reduce this movement rate.

A move action may not be split, thus it's not possible to move 10 feet (move action), shoot a bow (main action), and then move 20 feet (move action action).

### on turn actions

**On turn actions** are simple and quick actions. Like main and move actions, on turn actions are performed by participants when it's their turn. Whereas main and move actions are limited, as many on turn actions as the referee judges reasonable may be performed.

Example of on turn actions are, saying a few words, reloading a bow from a readied quiver, drawing out a readied object, and similar actions.

### instant actions
