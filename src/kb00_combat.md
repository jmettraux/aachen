## sides

A combat usually involves two sides, the player characters and their allies' side and the opposing side.

## rounds

A combat situation is divided in **rounds** of roughly six seconds. Every participant takes their turn during the round, then another round begins.

1. reaction roll if necessary
2. surprise round if necessary
3. initiative roll
4. round begins
  * initiative side takes their turns
  * other side takes their turns
  * go to 4, next round begins

## surprise

Attackers always try to achieve surprise.

To determine if a side surprise the other, an opposed roll DEX/Sneak versus WIS/Notice can be used. If the attackers DEX/Sneak roll prevails, they get a full round of action to themselves. Initiative is rolled when this surprise round ends.

If a group of undisciplined and/or poorly trained non-player characters is surprised, the referee might make a Morale check for them.

## initiative

The player character side throws 1d8 and adds the best DEX modifier found among them to the result. The opposing side does the same. The side with the highest result goes first. In case of tie, the player character side goes first.

Each side then lets act its members in any order they like. Once they have all had their turn, the other side starts acting. When both side have acted for the round, the next round begins, again starting with the side that initially won the initiative.

**Option:** Each player character rolls for their own initiative, 1d8 + DEX modifier. The referee rolls once for the opposing side. Advantage: it's not all or nothing, one or more player character may act before the opposing side. Disadvantage: order of action is not group decided, but dice decided, potentially hindering group tactics.

## action types

When it's their turn, a participant may perform one **main action** and one **move action**, in the order they deem appropriate.

**On turn actions** and **instant actions** are available too. Together, those 4 types of actions frame how participants structure their actions in the round.

### main actions

A **main action** takes up most of the participant's round. Attacking an adversary, casting a spell, drawing a downed ally into cover, are examples of main actions.

A participant may decide to turn their **main action** into a **move action**, effectively benefitting from two **move actions** for their round.

### move actions

The participant may move from zero to their normal movement rate, for a human participant, that's from 0 to 30 feet. Given the terrain and/or the circumstance the referee might reduce this movement rate.

A move action may not be split, thus it's not possible to move 10 feet (move action), shoot a bow (main action), and then move 20 feet (move action action).

### on turn actions

**On turn actions** are simple and quick actions. Like main and move actions, on turn actions are performed by participants when it's their turn. Whereas main and move actions are limited, as many on turn actions as the referee judges reasonable may be performed.

Example of on turn actions are, saying a few words, reloading a bow from a readied quiver, drawing out a readied object, and similar actions.

### instant actions

**Instant actions** are generally linked to talents and special powers. They are so fast and simple that they can be performed at any, even out of turn, they can be delayed until needed. There is no limit on the number of instant actions a participant can take (unless the instant action description says otherwise).

The referee decides on the execution orders if multiple instant actions are triggered at the same time.

### summary

For the round, a participant may perform

* on their turn, one **main action** (or a second **move action**)
* on their turn, one **move action**
* on their turn, as many **on turn actions** as allowed by the referee
* out of turn, as many **instant actions** as allowed by the referee

## attacks

To determine if an attack hits or not, 1d20 is rolled, the class attack bonus and the relevant attribute modifier (STR or DEX) are added. The skill level in Stab, Shoot or Punch is added as well. If the result is greater or equal to the oponents's Armor Class, then the attack hits.

For example, a 4th level fighter with a +1 STR modifier and Stab 1 attacks with a spear an AC 14 enemy guard. The fighter has to roll 1d20 + 4 (class attack bonus) + 1 (STR mod) + 1 (Stab level 1), so 1d20 + 6 and do 14 or better.

Unlike skill checks, no level in Stab, Shoot, or Punch is not counted as -1, but as -2. Thus if the fighter had no training in Stab, their hit roll would become 1d20 + 4 + 1 - 2, so 1d20 + 3.

The weapon dictates which attribute modifier is used, the rule of thumb is STR for melee weapons and DEX for ranged weapons.
