# Advancement

The referee decides when character level up. It generally happens during a period off adventure. The party trains and acquire new skills or confirm skill acquired through experience.

Advancement gains is usually dictated by the class or hybrid class the character belongs to.

Please note that backgrounds with a _Learning Advantage_ (artisan, religious, and elite) roll with advantage on checks against `Lea TC` to determine general skill increments or attempts at acquiring new traits.
