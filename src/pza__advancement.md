# Advancement

FIXME rework and restructure (make it shorter)

New PCs start out at level one, the most capable heroes in the kingdom might reach level ten.


## benefits

Upon reaching a new level, a character immediately gains the benefits of advancement. No special training is required as their abilities are assumed to have been honed by their adventures over the past level.

## roll additional hit points

One rolls the hit dice dictated by the class table and adds the `CON` modifier to each dice. If the new total is no greater than the old, the new total is the old total plus one.

Thus, a Fighter who reaches third level and has a +1 `CON` modifier would roll 3d6+9 to find their new hit point total. If they already had 15 points and a rolled a 12, they'd instead record 16 HPs as their new total.

## improve attack bonus

A character's base attack bonus improves according to their class and level, as given on the class chart.

Non-fighter characters who want to get better with their weapons without an increased attack bonus should consider improving their Slash, Shoot, or Punch skills.

## improve saving throws

The character becomes more capable of evading chance harms and perils. Their saving throw scores decrease by one, making it easier to to succeed on saving throws. Thus, a character with a saving throw score of 15 at first level, would have 14 at second level.

## improve skills

A character who advances a level gains **three skill points** they can spend on improving their skills, or improve attributes, or save to spend later.

Skills that are gained or improved immediately on gaining a level are assumed to have been perfected over the past level and require no training time or teaching.

If one saves their skill points to spend them later then they'll need to find some teacher or other explanation for developing them in the meanwhile. It doesn't take more than a week to refine their new ability, but one can't usually spend point mid-session to develop a skill.

The cost for improving a skill is listed below. Every skill level must be purchased in order; to gain level 1 in a skill you need to pay one point for level 0 and then two points for level 1. A character must be the requisite minimum level to increase a skill to certain levels.

A character cannot "partially buy" a skill level. If they don't have enough skill points to buy a new level, they need to save them up until they can.

A character cannot develop skills beyond level 4.

| New Skill Level | Skill Point Cost | Min Char Level |
|-----------------|------------------|----------------|
| 0               | 1                | 1              |
| 1               | 2                | 1              |
| 2               | 3                | 3              |
| 3               | 4                | 6              |
| 4               | 5                | 9              |

## improve attributes

Skill points may be used to improve an attribute score by one point, perhaps improving its modifier. An attribute may not be raised above a score of 18.

A character must reach a certain minimum level to improve their attribute scores. For example, to increase an attribute a first time, the character must have reached level 2. To increase an attribute a third time, the character must have reached level 3 or better.

An attribute improvement can be performed no more than five times, with the cost increasing each time. Thus, to boost one's `STR` score by +2, three skill points must be spent. Increasing `DEX` by +1 afterwards will then cost another three points, and the character must be at least third level to do so.

| Att Boost | Skill Point Cost | Min Char Level |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| First     | 1                | 2              |
| Second    | 2                | 2              |
| Third     | 3                | 3              |
| Fourth    | 4                | 6              |
| Final     | 5                | 9              |

Recompute downstream modifiers and saving throws as necessary.


## choose new talent

Finally, a character might be eligible to pick an additional level in a Focus. At levels 2, 5, 7, and 10, a character can increase one of his talent from level 1 to level 2, or pick a new Focus at level 1.

If this is the first level they've taken in the Focus, they might be granted a skill as a free bonus pick, depending on the Focus' benefits. During character creation, this bonus skill pick is treated like any other skill pick. If the Focus is taken as part of advancement, however, it instead counts as three skill points spent toward increasing the skill. This is enough to raise a non-existent skill to level 1, or boost a level 1 skill to level 2. They may do this even if they aren't high-enough level to normally qualify for a skill level that high.

If the skill points aren't quite enough to raise the skill to a new level, they remain as credit toward future advances. If applied to a skill that is already at level 4, the character can spend the three skill points on any other skill of their choice.


## changing leveling choices

Once made, talent picks, skill purchases, and other leveling choices are permanent. Some great sorcery or adventure reward might allow a reconfiguration, but a character is usually obliged to live with the choices they made.

An exception can be made by the referee if a particular choice or concept is proving troublesome in play or out of step with the rest of the group. Such reality rewrites should be reserved for genuine game problems, and not for the sake of "optimizing a build".
