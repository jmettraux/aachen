# Advancement

The class tables on pages 8 and 9 drive levelling up. Each time the character levels up, the table is consulted to add HPs, CPs, Skill levels and traits.

## CPs and HPs

TODO

<!--
For example, each time a `Caster` gains one level, they add 1d8-1 (min 1) HPs to their HP max and 1d8 CPs to their CP max. They then gain 1d3-1 (min 0) fighter skills, 1d4 general skills and 1d3 magic skills.

As was done at character creation 1d20 ≥ some `TC` is required, if successful, the dice is rolled at advantage (two dice rolled, the best is kept). For example, if our `Caster` rolls ≥ `CON TC`, they roll 2d8 for their HPs, ≥ `MEN TC`, 2d8 for their CPs, and so on (see class table).

## Skills

TODO

<!--
Rolling 3 for a skill group means that 3 skills may be "upped" in that group. As seen in character creation, a skill defaults to -2 and learning it makes it +0, the progression is then +1, +2, +3, etc. A skill is at most character level + 1 (for example, a fighter level 2, has at most +3 for a skill).
