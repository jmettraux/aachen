# Advancement

When
: between adventures, as the party recuperates;
: decided by the referee, milestone advancement.

How
: follow the class table to determine what gets upgraded;

Pattern
: like at Character Creation, a `TC` is indicated;
: if 1d20 ≥ `TC` then "advantage" is granted when rolling;
: _option_: on a 20 grant the max, on a 1 grant 1;
: Traits do not follow this pattern.

`Lea` advantage
: characters with a background of _Artisan_, _Religious_, or _Elite_ roll against `Lea TC` with advantage;
: characters with _Read_ +2 also obtain this advantage.

HPs
: HP total is increased.

CPs
: CP total is increased.

Skills
: increments are granted for Fighter, General, and Magic skills;
: an increment lets a player choose a new skill (at +0) or increase an already acquired skill score.

Spells
: a `Caster` is given 1d3 new spell forms / spell colours;
: a half-`Caster` is given 1d2 new spell forms / spell colours.

Traits
: the class table grants 2 to 3 attempts at acquiring traits;
: an attempt is a check 1d20 ≥ trait indicated `TC`;
: success → trait is acquired or improved;
: _(no prefix)_ → ·· ~~_very_~~ → ··· ~~_highly_~~.

Skills on the go
: as adventurers travel, skills are shared;
: limited that to practical skills, _Travel_, _Ride_, ...
: +1 or better character may bring -2 character to +0;
: on a successsful 1d20 + teacher _skill_ ≥ `Lea TC` check.

Flagged skills
: referee may ask to flag a skill where the character excelled;
: a flagged skill may be increased for free at level up time;
: a doubly flagged skill is increased on the spot;
: when a flagged skill is increased, the flags are removed.
