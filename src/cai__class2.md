# Determine Cast Points

Cast points are mana points, they're Cast Points here, because it _parallels_ with Hit Points (_Verb_ Points).

FIXME.


# Select Spells

A `Caster` or simply a character with the `Intricate` trait may select a few spells in accord with the referee. The background and the origin of the character might lead the referee to recommend certain spells.

A level 1 character knows (1 + `INT`m) spells (at least one). The referee is free to grant an extra known spell of choice.
