# skill checks

A skill check is done by rolling 2d6, adding the skill level and an attribute modifier. The skill and the attribute are determined by the referee. If the character has no skill level, -1 is added instead.

For example, to force a door open, the referee might demand a STR/Exert check. A character with a Strength of 17 and Exert of 1 would roll 2d6+1+1 = 2d6+2. If the character has no level in Exert, they would roll 2d6+1-1 = 2d6.

In a javelin precision throw contest, the referee might ask for a DEX/Shoot check, in a javelin distance throw contest, a STR/Exert or a DEX/Exert could be used.

The referee, prior to the check has decided on a difficulty, usually from 6 to 15. To succeed, the roll result must reach or exceed the difficulty.

## skill check outcome

In case of failure, the referee determines the outcome. The character simply fails or they succeed with some further complication of the situation.

|         | mod | description                                          |
|---------|----:|------------------------------------------------------|
|         |  -1 | Unskilled                                            |
| level 0 |  +0 | The proficiency of an ordinary practicioner          |
| level 1 |  +1 | Veteran of the skill, noticeably better than others  |
| level 2 |  +2 | Veteran and talented, one of the best in the city    |
| level 3 |  +3 | Inspirational master, one of the best in the kingdom |
| level 4 |  +4 | One of the best in the known world                   |

Skill levels are acquired at character creation and through advancement.

## skill check difficulty

|      | Skill Check Difficulty |
|:----:|------------------------|
|   5- | (no check needed)      |
|   6  | A relatively simple task that is still more than the character would usually be expected to manage in their regular background |
|   8  | A significant challenge to a competent professional that they'd still succeed at more often than not |
|  10  | Something too difficult to be expected of anyone but an expert, and even they might fail |
|  12  | Only a true master could expect to carry this off with any degree of reliability |
|  14+ | Only a true master has any chance of achieving this at all, and even they will probably fail |

The referee might increase the difficulty by 1 or 2 if they think that the skill is not completely relevant to the check.

Circumstances and tools might alter a skill check difficulty. Usually the referee should limit the total change from -2 to +2.

> or the perfect set of tools might give up to +2 bonus to the roll. Usually, no

> check.

## aiding a skill check

A character may want to help a comrade at a skill check. If the referee agrees, they ask of the player a relevant skill check against the same difficulty as the _helped_ skill check.

If the _help_ skill check succeeds, the _helped_ skill check gets a +1 bonus on its roll.

Multiple characters may try to help, but the maximum  bonus to the _helped_ skill check is +1.

The _helping_ skill check is against the same difficulty, but it's not necessarilty the same combination attribute/skill as the _helped_ skill check.

For example, TODO Adalric and Berthild

## opposed skill checks

Contests may be adjudicated via opposed skill checks. All participants roll with the same Ability / Skill combination and the one with the highest number wins. Ties go to player characters, or are re-rolled.

For example, in an archery contest, all participants could roll DEX/Shoot, the highest result is kept. If there is a tie, all the tied participant roll again. Repeat until there is only one participant, the winner, left.

Skill checks may also oppose different combinations of skills and attributes.

For example, a scout may roll DEX/Sneak against a sentinel WIS/Notice.

> profession. If the NPC has no reason to be particularly good at the challenge,
> they simply roll 2d6 and add nothing.

## skill check probabilities

To put the above skill check difficulties in perspective, here are success percentages for roll versus difficulty pairs:

| roll    | DC 6 | DC 7 | DC 8 | DC 9 | DC 10 | DC 11 | DC 12 | DC 13 | DC 14 |
|---------|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| 2d6 - 5 |  8.3 |  2.8 |  0.0 |  0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |

For example, a roll of 2d6+1 with a difficulty of 9 succeeds 41.6% of the time.
