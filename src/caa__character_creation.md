# Character Creation

Level
: A new character is level 1.

Attributes
: Determine `STR`, `DEX`, `CON`, `INT`, `WIS`, and `CHA`;
: Roll 3d6 and assign in order, replace lowest roll with a 14;
: **or** roll 3d6 six times and assign at will;
: **or** use the 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, 7 array.

Modifiers
: Compute `STR`m, `DEX`m, `CON`m, `INT`m, `WIS`m, and `CHA`m;
: 3 → **-2** | 4 to 7 → **-1** | 14 to 17 → **+1** | 18 → **+2**;
: so if `STR` is 18 then `STR`m is +2; if `INT` is 13 then `INT`m is +0.

Saves
: Compute the saving throw scores;
: `Physical` = 16 - (max(`STR`m, `CON`m)) - _character level_;
: `Evasion` = 16 - (max(`DEX`m, `INT`m)) - _character level_;
: `Mental` = 16 - (max(`WIS`m, `CHA`m)) - _character level_;
: `Luck` = 16 - _character level_.

Background
: Determine the background of the character;
: Then follow the background table to roll or pick skill levels.

Class
: Select a character class;
: `Fighter`, `Dabster`, or `Caster`.

Traits
: They represent side talents or particular specializations;
: Choose (1 + `CHA`m) traits, minimum 1;
: 1 extra trait if the character is a `Dabster`.

Skill[^1]
: Pick an extra skill level, to reflect the character's outside interests, natural talents, hobby expertise, etc.

Hit Points
: HP = `Fighter` → 1d6+2 | `Dabster` → 1d6 | `Caster` → 1d6-1;
: Add `CON`m, but HP minimum is 1.

Spells
: If the character has the `Intricate` or `Very Intricate` trait, select (1 + `INT`m) spells (at least one).

Cast Points
: _CP factor_ =<br/>non-`Caster` → 0 | `Caster` → max(`INT`m, `WIS`m, `CHA`m) |<br/>`Fighter-Caster` → `WIS`m | `Dabster-Caster` → `INT`m<br/>(at least 1 for a caster);
: CP =<br/>`Intricate` → _char level_ × _CP factor_ |<br/>`Very Intricate` → _char level_ + _char level_ × _CP factor_ |<br/>else 0.

Name
: Give the character a name.

Equipment
: Determine the equipment of the character with the referee.


[^1]:
  A new character may not exceed level 1 in a skill: should the creation lead you to reach level 2 in a skill, keep it at 1 and increment another skill.
