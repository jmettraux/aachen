# Character Creation

Level
: A new character is level 1.

Abilities~~→p4~~
: Determine `STR`, `DEX`, `CON`, `INT`, `WIS`, and `CHA`;
: Roll 2 series of 6 × 3d6; pick best of the 2; assign at will.

Ability TCs~~→p4~~
: Compute `STR TC`, `DEX TC`, `CON TC`, `INT TC`, `WIS TC`, and `CHA TC` where `XXX TC` = 21 - `XXX`;
: For example if `STR` is 17 then `STR TC` is 21 - 17 thus 4.

Saves~~→p4~~
: Compute the saving throw scores;
: `Physical` = mean of `STR TC` and `CON TC`, round up;
: `Evasion` = mean of `DEX TC` and `INT TC`, round up;
: `Mental` = mean of `WIS TC` and `CHA TC`, round up.

[^1]:
  Round down for a `TC`, else round up

INI and Learning~~→p4~~ [^1]
: INI mod = mean of (`DEX` and `WIS`), round down;
: Learning mod = mean of `INT TC` and `WIS TC`, round up.

Background~~→p6-7~~
: Determine the background of the character;
: Then follow the background table to roll or pick skill levels.

Class~~→p8-9~~
: Select a character class;
: `Fighter`, `Dabster`, or `Caster`.

Traits~~→p10-11~~
: They represent side talents or particular specializations;
: Choose a trait and if 1d20 ≥ Trait Ability TC, add 1 level to it, else nothing;
: 1 extra Trait attempt for a `Dabster`.

Skill~~→p12~~
: Pick an extra general skill (not a fighter skill, nor a magic skill).

Hit Points~~→p12~~
: `Fighter` → 1d8+3 | `Dabster` → 1d8 | `Caster` → 1d8-1;
: Roll 2d8, if 1d20  ≥ `CON TC`, pick the best d8, else the worst;
: Apply trait modifiers if any;
: Minimum HP is 1.

Cast Points~~→p12~~
: `Caster` → 1d8 | `Dabster/Fighter -Caster` → 1d6;
: Roll 2d8 (or 2d6),<br/>if 1d20 ≥ `Mental TC`, pick the best die, else the worst;
: Apply trait modifiers if any.

Spells~~→p12~~
: If the character has the `Intricate` or `Very Intricate` trait, select (1 + `INT`m) spells (at least one). **FIXME**

Name~~→p13~~
: Give the character a name.

Equipment~~→p14-15~~
: Determine the equipment of the character with the referee.

  A new character may not exceed level 1 in a skill: should the creation lead you to reach level 2 in a skill, keep it at 1 and increment another skill.
