# Character Creation

Level
: A new character is level 1.

~~p4~~Abilities
: Determine `STR`, `DEX`, `CON`, `INT`, `WIS`, and `CHA`;
: Roll 2 series of 6 × 3d6; pick best of the 2; assign at will.

~~p4~~Ability TCs
: Compute `STR TC`, `DEX TC`, `CON TC`, `INT TC`, `WIS TC`, and `CHA TC` where `XXX TC` = 21 - `XXX`;
: For example if `STR` is 17 then `STR TC` is 21 - 17 thus 4.

~~p4~~Saves
: Compute the saving throw scores;
: `Physical` = mean of `STR TC` and `CON TC`, round up;
: `Evasion` = mean of `DEX TC` and `INT TC`, round up;
: `Mental` = mean of `WIS TC` and `CHA TC`, round up.

[^1]:
  Round down for a `TC`, else round up

~~p4~~INI and Learning [^1]
: INI mod = mean of (`DEX` and `WIS`), round down;
: Learning mod = mean of `INT TC` and `WIS TC`, round up.

~~p8-9~~Class
: Select a character class;
: `Fighter`, `Dabster`, or `Caster`.

~~p10-11~~Traits

: Choose a trait and if 1d20 ≥ Trait Ability TC, add 1 level to it, else nothing;
: 1 extra Trait attempt for a `Dabster`.

: Pick an extra general skill (not a fighter skill, nor a magic skill).

~~p12~~Hit Points
: `Fighter` → 1d8+3 | `Dabster` → 1d8 | `Caster` → 1d8-1;
: Roll 2d8, if 1d20  ≥ `CON TC`, pick the best d8, else the worst;
: Apply trait modifiers if any;
: Minimum HP is 1.

~~p12~~Cast Points
: `Caster` → 1d8 | `Dabster/Fighter -Caster` → 1d6;
: Roll 2d8 (or 2d6),<br/>if 1d20 ≥ `Mental TC`, pick the best die, else the worst;
: Apply trait modifiers if any.

~~p12~~Spells
