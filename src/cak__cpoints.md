# Determine Cast Points

Cast points are mana points, they're Cast Points here, because it _parallels_ with Hit Points.

The ~~factor~~ is the max of the `INT`, `WIS`, or `CHA` modifier if the character is a `Caster`. It is the `WIS` modifier if a `Fighter-Caster`. It is the `INT` if a `Dabster-Caster`. In any case, it is at least 1.

Cast Points is _level_ * ~~factor~~ if the character has the `Intricate` trait. It is _level_ + (_level_ * ~~factor~~) if the character has the `Very Intricate` trait.

Non-caster characters have 0 CP.
