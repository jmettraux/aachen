# Determine Cast Points

Cast points are mana points, they're Cast Points here, because it _parallels_ with Hit Points (_Verb_ Points).

The ~~CP factor~~ is the max of `INT`m, `WIS`m, or `CHA`m if the character is a `Caster`. It is `WIS`m when a `Fighter-Caster`. It is `INT`m when a `Dabster-Caster`. In any case, it is at least 1.

Cast Points is _character level_ * ~~CP factor~~ if the character has the `Intricate` trait. It is _character level_ + (_character level_ * ~~CP factor~~) if the character has the `Very Intricate` trait. Non-caster characters have 0 CP.
