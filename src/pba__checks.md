# Checks

## general mechanism

If there is time pressure, opposition, or the task is dangerous, the referee might demand a check to the player (or roll for a NPC).

<!-- .comparison -->
1d20 + _modifier_ ≥ `DC`

The modifier is usually a skill, covering the task at hand. The `DC` might be a character Target Class (`TC`) or an opposing character `OC`.

For less passive opposed checks, the referee might rule that

<!-- .comparison -->
1d20 + _modifier_ ≥ opponent's 1d20 + _modifier_

where the modifier are the same skills or different skills.


## attack checks

An attack check follows the pattern above. The modifier is the weapon skill, while the `DC` is the opponent's Armor Class.

<!-- .comparison -->
1d20 + _weapon skill_ ≥ `AC`


## save checks

The referee might grant a save check to character. The modifier might be a skill or simply half the level or the hit dice (`HD`) rounded down. The target class (`TC`) has to be selected among `Physical TC`, `Evasion TC`, `Mental TC`, or any other `TC` on the character sheet.

<!-- .comparison -->
1d20 + _modifier_ ≥ `TC`

Should the `TC`s be unavailalbe for a creature, the referee might default to a mean 10 or 11 or to any difficulty class they deem appropriate.


## advantage and disadvantage

[^1]

[^1]:
  the referee might grant +2 or -2 instead of an advantage or disadvantage.

Depending on the circumstances, the referee might grant advantage or disadvantage on a check. Roll two d20s instead of one, and keep the highest in case of advantage or the lowest in case of disadvantage.


## ones and twenties

The referee decides if something extra happens on a natural 1 or a natural 20. They might even rule that nothing special happens.

## check examples

Remember, `TC`s are target classes, the lower the better, they are used when rolling against oneself. And `OC`s are opponent classes, the higher the better, as they are "presented" to the opponent as a `DC`.

Sneaking
: 1d20 + _Scout_ ≥ `EVA TC` ~~or~~
: 1d20 + _Scout_ ≥ opponent's 1d20 + _Spy_ ~~or~~
: 1d20 + _Scout_ ≥ opponent's `Learning DC` ~~or~~
: 1d20 + _Scout_ ≥ opponent's `WIS` (**not** `WIS TC`) ~~or~~
: 1d20 + _Scout_ ≥ static `DC`

Obtaining a discount
: 1d20 + _Trade_ ≥ `INT TC` ~~or~~
: 1d20 + _Trade_ ≥ `WIS TC` ~~or~~
: 1d20 + _Trade_ ≥ opponent's 1d20 + _Trade_

Shooting at the range
: 1d20 + _Bows_ ≥ `DEX TC`

Healing a character
: 1d20 + _Heal_ ≥ `INT TC` ~~or~~
: 1d20 + _Heal_ ≥ wounded's `CON TC`


## in summary

Against own's TC
: 1d20 + Skill ≥ Ability `TC` ~~or~~
: 1d20 + Skill ≥ Save `TC`

Against friend's TC
: 1d20 + Skill ≥ friend's Ability `TC` ~~or~~
: 1d20 + Skill ≥ friend's Save `TC`

Opposed check
: 1d20 + Skill ≥ opponent's 1d20 + Skill ~~or~~
: 1d20 + Skill ≥ opponent's 1d20 + other Skill ~~or~~
: 1d20 + Skill ≥ opponent's Ability (**not** abi `TC`)

Arbitrary DC
: 1d20 + Skill ≥ arbitrary DC (Difficulty Class)
