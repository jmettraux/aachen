# Checks

Skill check
: 1d20 + character _skill_ ≥ character `TC`; or
: 1d20 + character _skill_ ≥ opponent `DC`; or
: 1d20 + character _skill_ ≥ arbitrary `DC`;
: success → task succeeds.

Skill, `DC`, `TC`
: are decided by the referee;
: player may suggest alternatives.

Opposed check
: referee might decide the task is actively opposed;
: 1d20 + character _skill_ ≥ 1d20 + opponent _skill_;
: success → task succeeds.
: (yes, this favours the _initiating_ side)

No check unless
: the task is difficult and/or hazardous; or
: the task is performed under time pressure; or
: the referee decides so.

<hr/>

Attack check
: 1d20 + _weapon skill_ ≥ defender `AC`;
: success → defender takes damage.

<hr/>

Save check
: the referee might grant a _save_ against an impending danger;
: 1d20 + _modifier_ ≥ character `TC`;
: success → the danger is avoided completely or partially.

Modifier and `TC`
: are decided by the referee;
: player may suggest alternatives.

<hr/>

Dis|advantage
: referee might grant advantage or disadvantage to a check;
: roll 2 d20s instead of 1;
: keep the highest in case of advantage;
: keep the lowest when disadvantage.

1 and 20
: 1 → always a failure;
: 20 → always a success;
: referee is free to add _critical_ outcomes.

Remember, `TC`s are target classes, the lower the better, they are used when rolling against oneself. And `DC`s are opponent classes, the higher the better, as they are "presented" to the opponent.
