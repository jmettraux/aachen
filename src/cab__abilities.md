# Determine Abilities

<!-- .abilities -->
| Name         | Att   | Description              |
|--------------|-------|--------------------------|
| Strength     | `STR` | physical power           |
| Dexterity    | `DEX` | agility and coordination |
| Constitution | `CON` | hardiness and endurance  |
| Intelligence | `INT` | book smart               |
| Wisdom       | `WIS` | street smart             |
| Charisma     | `CHA` | force of character       |

Roll 2 series of 6 Ã— 3d6; pick best of the 2 series; assign the 6 numbers at will.

**Or** roll 3d6 and assign in order. Replace the lowest roll with a 14.

**Or** use the 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, 7 array and assign at will.

## Compute Initiative Modifier

The INItiative modifier is added to 1d20 when determining initiative rank at the beginning of a combat. It is equal to (`DEX` + `WIS`) / 2, rounding down (Ability scores, not their TCs).


## Compute Save/Mean TCs

<!-- .save-mean -->
| TC    | Use                 | Score (round up) |
|-------|---------------------|-------|
| Body  | Physical challenges | (`STR TC` + `CON TC` + `DEX TC`) / 3 |
| Soul  | Mental challenges   | (`INT TC` + `WIS TC` + `CHA TC`) / 3 |
| Physical | Against poison, disease, or exhaustion | (`STR TC` + `CON TC`) / 2 |
| Evasion  | Against sudden perils                 | (`DEX TC` + `INT TC`) / 2 |
| Mental   | Against spells, charms, or illusions  | (`WIS TC` + `CHA TC`) / 2 |
| Learning | When acquiring new skills or feats    | (`INT TC` + `WIS TC`) / 2 |
| Impulse  | Checking instictive reactions         | (`DEX TC` + `WIS TC`) / 2 |

_Evasion_ and _Impulse_ might seem interchangeable. _Impulse_ should be used over _Evasion_ when "gut feeling" is involved.
