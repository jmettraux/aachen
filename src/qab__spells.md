# Spells

Casters see the magical energy as threads of various colours. Each colour affects different _domains_. It is probable that some casters see colours differently, and that some of them don't see some of the colours.

Most of the casters choose simple, well known, forms for weaving their magical threads. Maybe in Constantinople or further east, there are casters that know more complicated forms.

## Élan

Many of the spell descriptions below mention _élan_. It is equal to the `Cast` skill level plus the attribute modifier used for casting the spell. So it varies from -2 to +6.

When a spell inflects damage and the dice roll plus the _élan_ results in zero or less, do inflect 1 point of damage.

For example, a caster with `INT`m -1, fires an ~~Amber Arrow~~ and rolls a 1. That computes to 0, but since it's about damage, it will actually inflect 1 point of damage.
