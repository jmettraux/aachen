# Spells

Casters see the magical energy as threads of various colours. It is probable that some casters see colours differently, and that some of them don't see some of the colours.

Most of the casters choose simple, well known, forms for weaving their magical threads. Maybe in Constantinople or further east, there are casters that know more complex forms.

A spell is a combination ~~Skill~~ × ~~Colour~~ × ~~Form~~.

A spell is also a negotiation between the referee and the player to determine how the fictional world is affected by the magic wielded by the character. There are no spell descriptions, the referee is free to interpret the guidelines provided here.

_Weave_
: the main way of using magic, by making threads

_Feel_
: feeling threads of magic

_Soak_
: absorbing energy as Casting Points

_Mutate_
: transforming threads

_Entwine_
: binding or combining threads

## Examples


<!-- .examples -->

_Weave_ ~~×~~ _Coal_ ~~×~~ _Arrow_
: an arrow of pain flying through the air to hit its target

_Feel_ ~~×~~ _Quartz_ ~~×~~ _Pole_
: a pole of meta threads the caster may use to probe for others' threads

_Soak_ ~~×~~ _Copper_ ~~×~~ _Finger_
: the caster attempts to soak magical energy from the soil through their finger
