The score is 16, minus the best of the DEX or INT modifiers, minus the character level.


## Mental

Resist psychic influence or mind-bending sorceries.

The score is 16, minus the best of the WIS or CHA modifiers, minus the character level.


## Luck

When only blind luck can save the character.

The score is a 16 minus the character level.
