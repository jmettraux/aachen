|     | Difficulty        |
|:---:|-------------------|
|  5- | (no check needed) |
|  6  | A relatively simple task that is still more than the character would usually be expected to manage in their regular background |
|  8  | A significant challenge to a competent professional that they'd still succeed at more often than not |
| 10  | Something too difficult to be expected of anyone but an expert, and even they might fail |
| 12  | Only a true master could expect to carry this off with any degree of reliability |
| 14+ | Only a true master has any chance of achieving this at all, and even they will probably fail |


# Skill Checks


## When To Check

* a task is difficult and hazardous,
* a task is performed under time pressure, or
* success or failure of the task is important or interesting

Old farm hands don't get skill checks each time they drive the cart to the market, it is routine work for them.


## How Not To Check

The referee might decide the task is too easy (DC < 6) or look at the character skill level and decide it is appropriate for an automatic success.

If there is time, the referee might look at the character skill level and decide how much time is spent until the task succeeds (DC < 9).


## Difficulty

The referee might increase the difficulty by 1 or 2 if they think that the skill is not completely relevant to the check.

Circumstances and tools might alter the DC. Usually the referee should limit the total change from -2 to +2.

## Probabilities

The table on the right shows probabilities for regular (2d6), advantage (highest 2 of 3d6), and disadvantage (lowest 2 of 3d6) rolls.

For example, a roll of 2d6+1 with a DC of 9 (target is 9 - 1 = 8), succeeds 41.67% of the time, with the advantage it becomes 68.06% (roughly equivalent to giving a +2), with the disadvantage it becomes 19.44% (roughly -2). These equivalent modifiers have to be taken with a pinch of salt.
