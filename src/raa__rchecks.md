# Skill Checks

Check when
: the task is difficult and/or hazardous; or
: the task is performed under time pressure; or
: success or failure is important or interesting.

Do not check when
: the task is too easy (`DC` < 6); or
: the character skill level is appropriate;
: referee grants success without a check;
: referee may impose a time cost (factoring in `DC` and skill).

Mechanism
: 1d20 + _modifier_ ≥ own `TC`;
: 1d20 + _modifier_ ≥ task `DC`;
: success → task completes successfully.

Modifier
: the skill level; or else
: -2 if the character has no exposure to the skill; or else
: (_Level_ or _HD_) / 2 (round down) if creature competent.

Difficulty
: character `TC`; or
: opponent `DC`; or
: arbitrary task `DC`.

1 and 20
: a 1 is always a failure;
: a 20 is always a success;
: referee should not call for a check for an impossible task.

<hr/>

Dis|advantage
: referee grants advantage or disadvantage as they see fit; or
: a lighter -3 to +3;
: note that a dis|advantage is equivalent to ± 4 or 5.

<hr/>

Mnemonic
: `TC` Transcend self / `DC` Defend self.

# Save Checks

Save `TC`s
: the referee grants a _save_ against an impending danger;
: 1d20 + _modifier_ ≥ `TC`;
: success → the danger is avoided completely or partially.

Modifier
: is a relevant defender skill; or
: defender's _Level_ / 2 round down; or
: defender's _HD_ / 2 round down for creatures.

<hr/>

Which `TC`
: see page 6;
: ~~Physical~~ `TC` against poison, disease, or exhaustion;
: ~~Evasion~~ `TC` against sudden perils;
: ~~Mental~~ `TC` against spells, charms, and illusions;
: the referee decides, any other `TC` may be used.

Quick Save `TC`
: 10; or
: arbitrary `TC`; or
: 3d6.

<hr/>

<!-- .with-preamble -->
&nbsp;
: _as an alternative:_

Saves as attacks
: the "danger" makes an attack roll against the character;
: 1d20 + _modifier_ ≥ `DC`;
: ~~failure~~ → defender avoids the danger completely or partially.

Modifier
: is a relevant attacker skill; or
: attacker's _Level_ / 2 round down; or
: attacker's _HD_ / 2 round down for creatures.

Which `DC`
: see above **Which `TC`** but use corresponding `DC`.

Quick Save `DC`
: 11; or
: arbitrary `DC`; or
: 3d6.

<hr/>

Dis|advantage
: referee grants advantage or disadvantage as they see fit; or
: a lighter -3 to +3;
: note that a dis|advantage is equivalent to ± 4 or 5.

<hr/>

Mnemonic
: `TC` Transcend self / `DC` Defend self.
