# Skill Checks


## When To Check

* a task is difficult and hazardous,
* a task is performed under time pressure, or
* success or failure of the task is important or interesting

Old farm hands don't get skill checks each time they drive the cart to the market, it is routine work for them.


## How Not To Check

The referee might decide the task is too easy (DC < 6) or look at the character skill level and decide it is appropriate for an automatic success.

If there is time, the referee might look at the character skill level and decide how much time is spent until the task succeeds (DC < 9).


## Difficulty

The referee might increase the difficulty by 1 or 2 if they think that the skill is not completely relevant to the check.

Circumstances and tools might alter the DC. Usually the referee should limit the total change from -2 to +2.

# Save Checks

Save `TC`s
: the referee grants a _save_ against an impending danger to a character;
: 1d20 ≥ `TC`;
: success → the danger is avoided completely or partially.

Which `TC`
: see page 6;
: ~~Physical~~ against poison, disease, or exhaustion;
: ~~Evasion~~ against sudden perils;
: ~~Mental~~ against spells, charms, and illusions;
: the referee decides, any other `TC` may apply.

Quick Save TC
: for characters and creatures without ability scores;
: TC ← 17 - (_Level_ or `HD`).

<hr/>

Saves as attacks
: the "danger" makes an attack roll on the character;
: 1d20 + _modifier_ ≥ `DC`;
: failure → the danger is avoided completely or partially;
: the referee grants a _modifier_, like an _attack modifier_ to the danger.
