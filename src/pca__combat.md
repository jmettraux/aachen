### Main Actions

A **main action** takes up most of the participant's round. Attacking an adversary, casting a spell, drawing a downed ally into cover, are examples of main actions.

A participant may decide to turn their **main action** into a **move action**, effectively benefitting from two **move actions** for their round.

### Move Actions

The participant may move from zero to their normal movement rate, for a human participant, that's from 0 to 30 feet. Given the terrain and/or the circumstance the referee might reduce this movement rate.

A move action may not be split, thus it's not possible to move 10 feet (move action), shoot a bow (main action), and then move 20 feet (move action action).

### On Turn Actions

**On turn actions** are simple and quick actions. Like main and move actions, on turn actions are performed by participants when it's their turn. Whereas main and move actions are limited, as many on turn actions as the referee judges reasonable may be performed.

Example of on turn actions are, saying a few words, reloading a bow from a readied quiver, drawing out a readied object, and similar actions.

### Instant Actions

**Instant actions** are generally linked to talents and special powers. They are so fast and simple that they can be performed at any, even out of turn, they can be delayed until needed. There is no limit on the number of instant actions a participant can take (unless the instant action description says otherwise).

The referee decides on the execution orders if multiple instant actions are triggered at the same time.

### Summary

For the round, a participant may perform

* on their turn, one **main action** (or a second **move action**)
* on their turn, one **move action**
* on their turn, as many **on turn actions** as allowed by the referee
* out of turn, as many **instant actions** as allowed by the referee

## In And Out Of Melee

TODO free attack

## Attacks

To determine if an attack hits or not, 1d20 is rolled, the class attack bonus and the relevant attribute modifier (STR or DEX) are added. The skill level in Slash, Shoot or Punch is added as well. If the result is greater or equal to the opponents's Armor Class, then the attack hits.

For example, a 4th level fighter with a +1 STR modifier and Slash 1 attacks with a spear an AC 14 enemy guard. The fighter has to roll 1d20 + 4 (class attack bonus) + 1 (STR mod) + 1 (Slash level 1), so 1d20 + 6 and do 14 or better.

Unlike skill checks, no level in Slash, Shoot, or Punch is not counted as -1, but as -2. Thus if the fighter had no training in Slash, their hit roll would become 1d20 + 4 + 1 - 2, so 1d20 + 3.

The weapon dictates which attribute modifier is used, the rule of thumb is STR for melee weapons and DEX for ranged weapons. Some weapons let the user choose between STR and DEX, the attribute modifier is used for the attack hit roll and the attack damage roll (and eventually shock damage).

### Melee Attacks

Melee attacks usually have a _range_ of 5 feet. Some weapons or creature attacks have the _long_ trait, letting them target foes within 10 feet.

TODO

| Circumstance                          | Mod |
|---------------------------------------|----:|
| Melee attacking an adjacent prone foe |  +2 |
| Melee attacking while prone           |  -4 |

### Ranged Attacks

Ranged weapon and creature ranged attacks have a short and a long range. For example, a large bow is 100ft / 600ft. From 100ft to 600ft, the modifier is -2, beyond 600ft, no chance to hit.

| Circumstance                                     | Mod |
|--------------------------------------------------|----:|
| Shooting at an adjacent prone foe                |  +2 |
| Shooting at long range                           |  -2 |
| Shooting at a distant prone foe                  |  -2 |
| Shooting a single handed weapon while in contact |  -4 |
| The target is at least half behind cover         |  -2 |
| The target is almost completely in cover         |  -4 |

Shooting a two-handed weapon while in contact is not allowed.

### Damage

TODO

### Shock Damage

Some weapons or creature attacks have _shock damage_. It is expressed as dmg / AC and only applies to melee attacks.

Shock damage indicates the minimum amount of damage inflicted, miss or not. The STR or DEX modifier applies, magical bonuses apply too.

If the opponent AC is superior to the shock damage target AC, shock damage is not considered.

For example a fighter with STR +1 uses a "2 / AC 13" sword. An opponent with an AC of 13 or less gets at least 2 + 1 points of damage should the fighter make a melee attack on them. In case of hit, 1d8 + 1 (STR) is rolled, a roll of 1 or 2 both inflict 3 points of damage.
