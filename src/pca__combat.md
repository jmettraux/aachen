## Attacks

To determine if an attack hits or not, 1d20 is rolled, the class attack bonus and the relevant attribute modifier (STR or DEX) are added. The skill level in Slash, Shoot or Punch is added as well. If the result is greater or equal to the opponents's Armor Class, then the attack hits.

For example, a 4th level fighter with a +1 STR modifier and Slash 1 attacks with a spear an AC 14 enemy guard. The fighter has to roll 1d20 + 4 (class attack bonus) + 1 (STR mod) + 1 (Slash level 1), so 1d20 + 6 and do 14 or better.

Unlike skill checks, no level in Slash, Shoot, or Punch is not counted as -1, but as -2. Thus if the fighter had no training in Slash, their hit roll would become 1d20 + 4 + 1 - 2, so 1d20 + 3.

The weapon dictates which attribute modifier is used, the rule of thumb is STR for melee weapons and DEX for ranged weapons. Some weapons let the user choose between STR and DEX, the attribute modifier is used for the attack hit roll and the attack damage roll (and eventually shock damage).

### Melee Attacks

Melee attacks usually have a _range_ of 5 feet. Some weapons or creature attacks have the _long_ trait, letting them target foes within 10 feet.
