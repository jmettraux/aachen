Image alteration shield.

This shield is sometimes called the "past window". The image seen through it is the same as the image that passed at the moment it was weaved. It can thus be used for some invisibility tricks. But it works both ways, the other side looks like what it was at weaving time and vice versa. You can move behind the shield, but looking through it won't tell you much about the current situation there.

The caster may decide to simply use it as a mirror. All the the light going through it is reflected. Both sides.

More static uses of the ball are common, to simply prevent light/vision from crossing the ball radius.

<!-- </div> -->

<!-- <div.spell> -->

## Night Disk ~~37~~

* **Rng** S 10ft/CP
* **Dia** 5ft/CP
