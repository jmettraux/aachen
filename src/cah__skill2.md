# Select an Extra Skill

<!--
Pick one skill to reflect the character's outside interests, natural talents, hobby expertise, or other personal focus.

**Option:** picking a level in a skill already acquired. But remember, no novice character skill level can exceed 1.
-->

Give the character a level 0 in a not yet acquired skill, to reflect their outside interests, natural talents, hobby expertise, or other personal focus.

In accord with the referee, that allowance might be diverted towards an already acquired skill, but remember, no novice character skill level can exceed 1. The character might be so focused on his core training that he has no time left.

Particular referees might rule that this extra skill is theirs to choose, with the only concession to characters with the _Elite_ background, "they have servants, thus have the time for a hobby, all the others, increase your `Work` skill and shut up."
