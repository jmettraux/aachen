For example, a character of level 3 with a DEX modifier of +2 has to roll 11 or better on a d20 to avoid falling in a suddenly spotted pit, that's 50%.

The fighter in the example above had a hit roll 1d20 + 6 and do 14 or better. So the target is 8, at 65%. Giving the advantage makes the probability jump to 87.75% (which is equivalent to giving a +5).
