## Skill Checks

To put the above skill check difficulties in perspective, here are success percentages for roll versus difficulty pairs:

| 2d6 | DC 6 | DC 7 | DC 8 | DC 9 | DC 10 | DC 11 | DC 12 | DC 13 | DC 14 | DC 15 |
|-----|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| - 5 |  8.3 |  2.8 |  0.0 |  0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |

| - 1 | 58.3 | 41.7 | 27.8 | 16.7 |   8.3 |   2.8 |   0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |
| + 0 | 72.2 | 58.3 | 41.6 | 27.7 |  16.7 |   8.3 |   2.8 |   0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |

| + 2 | 91.6 | 83.3 | 72.2 | 58.3 |  41.6 |  27.7 |  16.7 |   8.3 |   2.8 |   0.0 |
| + 3 | 97.2 | 91.6 | 83.3 | 72.2 |  58.3 |  41.6 |  27.7 |  16.7 |   8.3 |   2.8 |
| + 4 |  100 | 97.2 | 91.6 | 83.3 |  72.2 |  58.3 |  41.6 |  27.7 |  16.7 |   8.3 |
| + 5 |  100 |  100 | 97.2 | 91.6 |  83.3 |  72.2 |  58.3 |  41.6 |  27.7 |  16.7 |
| + 6 |  100 |  100 |  100 | 97.2 |  91.6 |  83.3 |  72.2 |  58.3 |  41.6 |  27.7 |
| + 7 |  100 |  100 |  100 |  100 |  97.2 |  91.6 |  83.3 |  72.2 |  58.3 |  41.6 |

For example, a roll of 2d6+1 with a difficulty of 9 succeeds 41.6% of the time.

Here is a table about advantage (highest 2 of 3d6) and disadvantage (lowest 2 of 3d6) for skill checks:

| Target |   2d6   |    Adv  |  ~ |    Dis  |  ~ |
|-------:|--------:|--------:|---:|--------:|---:|
|      2 | 100.00% | 100.00% | +0 | 100.00% |  0 |
|      3 |  97.22% |  99.54% | +1 |  92.59% | -1 |
|      4 |  91.67% |  98.15% | +1 |  80.09% | -1 |
|      5 |  83.33% |  94.91% | +2 |  64.35% | -2 |
|      6 |  72.22% |  89.35% | +2 |  47.69% | -2 |
|      7 |  58.33% |  80.56% | +2 |  31.94% | -2 |
|      8 |  41.67% |  68.06% | +2 |  19.44% | -2 |
|      9 |  27.78% |  52.31% | +2 |  10.65% | -2 |
|     10 |  16.67% |  35.65% | +2 |   5.09% | -2 |
|     11 |   8.33% |  19.91% | +1 |   1.85% | -1 |
|     12 |   2.78% |   7.41% | +1 |   0.46% |  0 |

For example, a roll of 2d6+1 with a difficulty of 9 (target is 9 - 1 = 8), succeeds 41.67% of the time, with the advantage it becomes 68.06% (roughly equivalent to giving a +2), with the disadvantage it becomes 19.44% (roughly -2). These equivalent modifiers have to be taken with a pinch of salt.

## Saving Throws

TODO explain table below

| level |    | -2  |    | -1  |    |  0  |    |  1  |    |  2  |
|------:|---:|:---:|---:|:---:|---:|:---:|---:|:---:|---:|:---:|
|     1 | 17 | 20% | 16 | 25% | 15 | 30% | 14 | 35% | 13 | 40% |
|     2 | 16 | 25% | 15 | 30% | 14 | 35% | 13 | 40% | 12 | 45% |
|     3 | 15 | 30% | 14 | 35% | 13 | 40% | 12 | 45% | 11 | 50% |
|     4 | 14 | 35% | 13 | 40% | 12 | 45% | 11 | 50% | 10 | 55% |
|     5 | 13 | 40% | 12 | 45% | 11 | 50% | 10 | 55% |  9 | 60% |
|     6 | 12 | 45% | 11 | 50% | 10 | 55% |  9 | 60% |  8 | 65% |
|     7 | 11 | 50% | 10 | 55% |  9 | 60% |  8 | 65% |  7 | 70% |
|     8 | 10 | 55% |  9 | 60% |  8 | 65% |  7 | 70% |  6 | 75% |
|     9 |  9 | 60% |  8 | 65% |  7 | 70% |  6 | 75% |  5 | 80% |
|    10 |  8 | 65% |  7 | 70% |  6 | 75% |  5 | 80% |  4 | 85% |

For example, a character of level 3 with a DEX modifier of +2 has to roll 11 or better on a d20 to avoid falling in a suddenly spotted pit, that's 50%.
