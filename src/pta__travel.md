# Travel TODO

## Travel Speed

These are average travel speeds, infrastructure and terrain will alter them:

| Terrain      | per day      | bad weather   | night       |
|--------------|:------------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|
| plain        | 24mi / 36km  | 12mi / 18km   | 18mi / 27km |
| mountain     | 12mi / 19km  |  6mi /  9km   |  6mi /  9km |
| forest       | 18mi / 27km  | 12mi / 18km   | 12mi / 18km |
| by boat      | 48mi / 72km  | 24mi / 36km   | 36mi / 54km |
| under ground |  6mi /  9km  |  6mi /  9km   |  6mi /  9km |

## Hunting

The party may attempt a WIS + Hunt skill check for every 6 hours of hunting. The difficulty is 8 most places. For every point succeeded by, meat for 1 man per day is obtained.

Each day of hunting in the same hex (6mi / 9km), increases the difficulty by 2.

On a natural roll of 2 or 3, some danger or trouble has befallen the hunting party (or the party was discovered by the rightful owner of the land in the middle of poaching it).

## Foraging

...TODO<!-- RETURN -->

The party may attempt a WIS + Survive skill check. The difficulty is 8 for woodlands, and it may climb to 12 or more for desert lands.

On success, the foraging party collects 1d6 units plus the sum of the party's survival skill level (-1 for those without a survival skill level), the maximum is 10.

A forage unit is either 1 day of food for 1 person, 1 day of water for 1 person or a night firewood for the party.

Characters native from the wilds will never find less than 2 units of forage, barring extreme situations.

## Hunting, foraging, preserving

In some places where hunting is forbidden, foraging might be an alternative. When water is necessary, foraging is mandatory.

Foraged food and hunted meat units are unpreserved and will spoil in three days. Smoking or drying a reasonable amount of food units requires 1 fire unit and half a day of labour.

## Encounters

For every day of travel, the referee should roll for a random encounter. A base frequency would 1 on a d6, depending on the type of encounters and the type of terrain, the referee could go to 1 on a d4 or 1 on a d8.

In case of encounter, the referee should roll again on a d6, 1-4 means daylight encounter, while 5-6 means it happens after nightfall.

An alternative would be to roll once per day of travel and one per night of camping, lowering the the frequency by choosing a dice with more faces.

It's the part of the referee's preparation work to come up with an encounter table for a region or a travel. Not all encounters are hostile.
