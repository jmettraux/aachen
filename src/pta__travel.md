# Travel

Distance
: the party thinks in term of "day of travel";
: referee might translate that to distances, roughly;
: easy terrain → 24mi / 36km;
: by boat → 48mi / 72km;
: under ground → 6mi / 9km;
: factor in season, weather, and infrastructure.

Organizing
: party hires a _guide_ or appoints a _navigator_;
: party appoints _packmaster_, _campmaster_ and _huntmaster_;
: _scouts_ are sent 120yd 360ft 100m 70sq ahead of the van if necessary;
: _campmaster_ appoints _watchers_ and decides watch order.

Packing
: pack animals should be carefully harnessed and loaded;
: _packmaster_ rolls 1d20 + _Ride_ or _Travel_ ≥ `Lea TC` or referee-set `DC`;
: a poorly harnessed and loaded animal will quickly be unusable.

Navigating
: in non-familiar environments,<br/> _navigator_ rolls 1d20 + _Travel_ ≥ `Lea TC` or referee-set `DC`;
: failure → party gets lost.

Sailing
: favour _Sail_ over _Travel_.

<hr/>

Camping
: _campmaster_ rolls 1d20 + _Build_ or _Travel_ ≥ `Wis TC` or referee-set `DC`;
: failure → not so comfortable, rest not optimal.

Grazing
: after unloading pack horses and mules can be left to graze;
: ground cover and season may require using dedicated rations for the pack animals;
: sufficient rest and care has to be given to pack animals.

<hr/>

Foraging
: happens while travelling;
: each character rolls 1d20 + _Gather_ ≥ `Wis TC` or referee-set `DC`;
: success → 1 daily ration obtained.

Hunting
: instead of travelling, the party spends one day hunting;
: _huntmaster_ rolls 1d20 + _Hunt_ ≥ `Wis TC` or referee-set `DC`;
: success → 2d8 + hunter count daily rations are obtained;
: failure → 1d6 rations are obtained.

Preserving
: rations obtained through foraging or hunting will last 3 days;
: with enough fuel and half a day of work,<br/>3 daily rations per character may be preserved;
: travel rations last for one month.

Drinking
: travellers usually can refill their waterskins while travelling; but
: at sea or in dry environments → strict water supply tracking.


[^1]:
  When routine sets in, the referee might decide to skip some rolls, only considering skill level.

  After a successful travel, the referee may grant a _Travel_ +0 to the characters.

## Encounters

For every day of travel, the referee should roll for a random encounter. A base frequency would 1 on a d6, depending on the type of encounters and the type of terrain, the referee could go to 1 on a d4 or 1 on a d8.

In case of encounter, the referee should roll again on a d6, 1-4 means daylight encounter, while 5-6 means it happens after nightfall.

An alternative would be to roll once per day of travel and one per night of camping, lowering the the frequency by choosing a dice with more faces.

It's the part of the referee's preparation work to come up with an encounter table for a region or a travel. Not all encounters are hostile.
