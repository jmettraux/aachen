# Exploration TODO

A "site" may be a dungeon, an old ruin, an underground site.

Time in a site is measured in turns of ten minutes. Most of the things adventurers will wish to do will take a turn to accomplish, taking into account the packing and unpacking of gear, the need to listen carefully while working, and the desire and/or need to do all things quietly and carefully.


## Movement

There are three modes of movement in a site.

_Cautious movement_[^2] is at a speed of hundred and twenty feet per turn. At a cautious pace, the adventurers are pacing out distances, making a map, checking carefully for any features of interest around them, and doing all this as quietly and stealthily as possible.

[^2]: Cautious movement is 120 ft per turn

_Swift movement_[^3] is at thrice the speed, three hundred and sixty feet per turn. The party moving switfly is merely reading their map as it ventures through an area they have already explored and are making no effort to examine again as they pass through. They are maintaining some quiet, but are not as careful as a Cautious party.

[^3]: Swift movement is 360 ft per turn

_Running movement_[^rm] generally lets adventurers reach any location in most sites with ten minutes of running. They may not consult their map and must simply tell the referre which turns they take and passages they venture down. They must halt for the remainder of the turn when a door must be opened or a barrier overcome, and then rest will be needed if they are not to be wearied.

[^rm]: Running movement is indefinite, but reckless


## Resting

~~TODO~~

<!-- RETURN -->

Adventurers must rest[^4] for one turn every hour or else they becomes wearied. Heroes who spend any time in Running movement must rest for a turn immediately after each turn of doing so.[^5] Those who engage in battle must also immediately spend a turn afterwards resting.

[^4]: One must rest 1 turn in 6 when exploring
[^5]: One must rest 1 turn after each fight or each turn of running

Those who do not rest suffer a -2 penalty to skill checks and a -4 penalty to hit rolls until they spend a turn recovering.


## Lighting

A pitch torch[^pt] casts usable light up to thirty feet and lasts for three turns (thirty minutes).

[^pt]: Torches last 3 turns and cast light at 30 ft

An oil lamp[^ol] with a full flask of oil will burn for 6 turns (one hour), yet cast only ten feet of usable light.

[^ol]: A lamp lasts six turns and casts light at 10 ft

Adventurers bearing light sources can never surprise foes lurking in the darkness.


## Surprise

Exploring a ruin or underground tunnels expose the party to surprise.

When one group comes suddenly on another, there is a chance of surprise. Adventurers in cautious movement cannot be surprised unless the foes leap on them from ambush or otherwise have some great advantage in concealment.

Those in swift movement risk surprise whenever their movement carries them into an occupied place.

Those in running movement are always surprised whenever they encounter others.

If surprise is uncertain, let the concealed or discovered party's most stealthy character make a DEX/Stealth skill check and the discovering party's most keen-eyed member make a WIS/Scout skill check. If the concealed party beats the discovering party, then they surprise them. It is conceivably possible that both groups might be surprised in some situations. In that case, let both groups make WIS/Scout checks against a difficulty 9, and any who lose are surprised.

A group that is surprised loses a full round of action to their ambushers. Once their foes have taken a round of action, Initiative is rolled as normal and the encounter progresses. let the referee not forget the Reaction Roll for encounters, but remember that a hungry foe who has won surprise on the adventuring party may be that much more inclined to leap immediately into the fray.


## Random Encounters

Random encounters[^re] are rolled every two turns in some sites. The referee rolls a d6, and on a result of 1 then there is some encounter with an inhabitant of the place. The encounter begins at a distance of 2d4 times 10 feet.

[^re]: 1 in 6 chance of an encounter

If the encounter is heard approaching and there is a convenient place to hide, the adventurers might be able to conceal themselves.

The referee may decide to omit a random encounter check if the playing characters are staying out of the communication lanes of the site or are in some very seldom-occupied corner of it.

Conversely[^re2], the referee may increase the odds to 2 in 6 or even 3 in 6 if the adventurers have made great tumult and trouble or if they have been running recklessly.

[^re2]: Running or loud action increases the chance to 2 or even 3 in 6


## Mapping the Site

One or more members of the adventuring party might be mapping the site as they progress. They might be using a piece of charcoal and a piece of parchment.

The mapper asks questions when there are uncertainties. The referee should not correct errors and misunderstandings.

The adventurers may consult their map while navigating, unless they are running or there is not enough light to read.
