# Exploration

Site
: underground site or a ruin, a "dungeon".

Turn
: an exploration turn lasts 10 minutes.

Cautious Movement
: 120ft 36m 24sq FFF per turn;
: mapping and searching for features of interest,<br/>quietly and stealthily;
: cannot be surprised unless foe is carefully concealed.

Swift Movement
: 360ft 108m 72sq 4Vtt per turn;
: merely travelling in an already explored area;
: scout forward.

Running Movement [^1]
: indefinite, but reckless;
: map may not be consulted;
: may last only for one turn;
: must rest after a turn of running.

Surprise
: those who run are always surprised;
: a party bearing light sources cannot surprise foes lurking in the dark;
: in doubt, roll 1d20 + _Scout_ ≥ `WIS TC` for both sides, both win, no surprise, both lose, no surprise;
: the surprised side concedes a whole combat round.

[^1]:
  the referee may call for an _Exert_ check, like 1d20 + _Exert_ ≥ `CON TC`

## Surprise

Exploring a ruin or underground tunnels expose the party to surprise.

When one group comes suddenly on another, there is a chance of surprise. Adventurers in cautious movement cannot be surprised unless the foes leap on them from ambush or otherwise have some great advantage in concealment.

Those in swift movement risk surprise whenever their movement carries them into an occupied place.

Those in running movement are always surprised whenever they encounter others.

If surprise is uncertain, let the concealed or discovered party's most stealthy character make a DEX/Stealth skill check and the discovering party's most keen-eyed member make a WIS/Scout skill check. If the concealed party beats the discovering party, then they surprise them. It is conceivably possible that both groups might be surprised in some situations. In that case, let both groups make WIS/Scout checks against a difficulty 9, and any who lose are surprised.

A group that is surprised loses a full round of action to their ambushers. Once their foes have taken a round of action, Initiative is rolled as normal and the encounter progresses. let the referee not forget the Reaction Roll for encounters, but remember that a hungry foe who has won surprise on the adventuring party may be that much more inclined to leap immediately into the fray.

A "site" may be a dungeon, an old ruin, an underground site.

Time in a site is measured in turns of ten minutes. Most of the things adventurers will wish to do will take a turn to accomplish, taking into account the packing and unpacking of gear, the need to listen carefully while working, and the desire and/or need to do all things quietly and carefully.
