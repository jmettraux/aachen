## Surprise

Exploring a ruin or underground tunnels expose the party to surprise.

When one group comes suddenly on another, there is a chance of surprise. Adventurers in cautious movement cannot be surprised unless the foes leap on them from ambush or otherwise have some great advantage in concealment.

Those in swift movement risk surprise whenever their movement carries them into an occupied place.

Those in running movement are always surprised whenever they encounter others.

If surprise is uncertain, let the concealed or discovered party's most stealthy character make a DEX/Stealth skill check and the discovering party's most keen-eyed member make a WIS/Scout skill check. If the concealed party beats the discovering party, then they surprise them. It is conceivably possible that both groups might be surprised in some situations. In that case, let both groups make WIS/Scout checks against a difficulty 9, and any who lose are surprised.

A group that is surprised loses a full round of action to their ambushers. Once their foes have taken a round of action, Initiative is rolled as normal and the encounter progresses. let the referee not forget the Reaction Roll for encounters, but remember that a hungry foe who has won surprise on the adventuring party may be that much more inclined to leap immediately into the fray.

A "site" may be a dungeon, an old ruin, an underground site.

Time in a site is measured in turns of ten minutes. Most of the things adventurers will wish to do will take a turn to accomplish, taking into account the packing and unpacking of gear, the need to listen carefully while working, and the desire and/or need to do all things quietly and carefully.

## Random Encounters

Random encounters[^re] are rolled every two turns in some sites. The referee rolls a d6, and on a result of 1 then there is some encounter with an inhabitant of the place. The encounter begins at a distance of 2d4 times 10 feet.

[^re]: 1 in 6 chance of an encounter

If the encounter is heard approaching and there is a convenient place to hide, the adventurers might be able to conceal themselves.

The referee may decide to omit a random encounter check if the playing characters are staying out of the communication lanes of the site or are in some very seldom-occupied corner of it.

Conversely[^re2], the referee may increase the odds to 2 in 6 or even 3 in 6 if the adventurers have made great tumult and trouble or if they have been running recklessly.

[^re2]: Running or loud action increases the chance to 2 or even 3 in 6


## Mapping the Site

One or more members of the adventuring party might be mapping the site as they progress. They might be using a piece of charcoal and a piece of parchment.

The mapper asks questions when there are uncertainties. The referee should not correct errors and misunderstandings.

The adventurers may consult their map while navigating, unless they are running or there is not enough light to read.
