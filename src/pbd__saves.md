# Saving Throws

A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to resist magic, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. Referees request saving throws from characters under an imminent threat or resisting an effect.[^1]

A saving throw is done with a d20. It succeeds if equal or greater than the saving throw score.

A successful saving throw means that the character suffers no harm, or reduced harm.

Saving throws are computed from 16 minus the best of two attribute modifiers minus the character level.

[^1]:
  Note that saving are meant to be last-ditch chances to avoid the worst of
  unusual perils or uncommon dangers. You can't make an Evasion saving throw to
  dodge a sword stroke; that's what the hit roll is for. It's up to the referee
  to decide whether a particular danger might allow a saving throw or not.

## The Saves

The saving throws are:

* Physical (Resistance) Save
* Mental (Resistance) Save
* Evasion ( / Dodge) Save
* (Sheer) Luck Save

### Physical Saves

A physical resistance save. The referee may request a physical saving throw to determine how a character resists a poison, a disease, or exhaustion.

Physical saves are equal to 16, minus the best of the STR and the CON modifiers, minus the character level.

### Mental Saves

A mental resistance save. The referee may request mental saving throws against magical effect, illusions, or to ward off tempations and ascertain a character's willpower.

Mental saves are equal to 16, minus the best of the WIS and the CHA modifiers, minus the character level.

### Evasion Saves

An evasion save. Diving and dodging from sudden explosions, pits, and perils, when swiftness and reaction speed are challenged.

Evasion saves are equal to 16, minus the best of the INT and the DEX modifiers, minus the character level.

### Luck Saves

Luck saves are not rooted in any attribute. When sheer good luck is the last ditch defense.

Luck saves are equal to 16, minus the character level.
