# Combat Actions

[^1]:
  <!-- .abbreviations -->
  MA
  : Main Action

  MvA
  : Move Action

  OTA
  : On Turn Action

  IA
  : Instant Action


Move
: **MvA**
: The character moves at their normal movement rate (30ft 9m 6sq t for a human);
: Halve the movement rate in case of difficult terrain or progressing prone;
: Some terrains might even require a 1d20 + _Exert_ â‰¥ `STR TC` skill check or some other check success to secure even the half rate.

Make a Melee Attack
: **MA**
: Make a melee attack with a readied melee weapon, see previous page.

Make a Ranged Attack
: **MA**
: Make a ranged attack with a readied ranged weapon, see previous page.

Cast a Spell
: **MA**
: Cast a spell, with a free hand.

Use A Skill
: **MA**
: The character uses a skill that could be plausibly applied in a few seconds.
: The referee will probably require a dice roll as the skill usage is attempted under pressure, under fire.

~~Take Action After~~ [^1]
: **OTA**
: The character declares it will act **after** another participant has acted;
: Unlike `Hold Action`, the character cannot change their mind and act earlier;
: Unlike `Hold Action`, it doesn't consume a **MvA**.

~~Hold Action~~
: **MvA**
: The character foregoes their **MvA** to hold their action until later in the round;
: The remaining **MA** is triggered as a **IA** when the character wishes it;
: Held actions are resolved before other characters' impeding actions.

Make a Charge Attack
: **MvA** + **MA**
: Rush in straight line from at least 30ft (9m 6sq t) up to 60ft (18m 12sq tt) and hurl a spear or make a melee attack with a +2 attack roll bonus.
: -2 penalty to AC until the whole combat round ends.

Go Total Defense
: **IA** + **MA**
: As an Instant Action (so even before their own turn), the character chooses to focus on avoiding anything hurled at them;
: It consumes the character Main Action;
: The character gains a +2 to their AC until their next turn and is immune to shock damage;
: It is OK to decide to _Go Total Defense_ right after a foe has rolled their attack, thus potentially turning their hit into a miss.

Make a Snap Attack
: **IA** + **MA**
: The character decides to act immediately (before his turn), sacrificing accuracy for speed. They _Make a Melee Attack_ or _Make a Ranged Attack_ against a foe in range;
: The attack takes a -4 penalty to its hit roll.
: If multiple combatants decide to _Make a Snap Attack_ at the same time, they are resolved simultaneously;
: (if the character is a nameless NPC, the referee shouldn't bother granting them snap attacks).

Make a Fighting Withdrawal
: **MA**
: The character disengages from any melee opponents around them. They don't actually move away, but they can now move away (**MvA**) from their opponents without granting them a free melee attack;
: If the character doesn't move, the opponents might re-engage them.

Go Prone
: **OTA**
: The character falls flat, forcing a -2 penalty on the to hit roll of ranged attacker;
: Although adjacent melee and ranged opponents get a +2 to hit instead.

Drop an Item
: **IA**
: The character drops an item they were holding. They can do it instantly to free up their hands.

Pick Up An Item
: **MvA**
: The character scoops up an object off the floor if they have a free hand, leaving it readied in their grip.

Ready Or Stow An Item
: **MA**
: The character draws a weapon, extracts an item from their pack, or otherwise moves an object around on their person.

Reload A Weapon
: **MA**
: The character reloads a weapon like a crossbow with a quarrel from a readied quiver;
: Bows can be reloaded as an On Turn Action (**OTA**), assuming the character has a readied quiver and at least +1 for their particular weapon skill; other wise it's a Move Action (**MvA**).

Stand Up
: **MvA**
: The character gets up from a prone position, gathering any dropped belongings if they so desire;
: Characters that have just come out of unconsciousness must get up before they do much else.

Screen An Ally
: **MvA**
: ~~FIXME~~
: The character moves up to their normal move rate towards an ally and then physically blocks opponents from attacking them, provided they remain within ten feet. Until the character's next turn, enemies who wish to make a melee or ranged attack against the screened ally must succeed a STR or DEX based skill check against the screener using the combat skill applicable to their weapon; on a failure, the attack roll is automatically directed toward the screening character.
: A character can screen against a number of attackers in one round equal to their combat skill; thus Stab-2 lets them block two attackers. Characters with level-0 or worse combat skills can't effectively screen. Multiple characters can try to screen the same ally; in such a case, the attacker's skill check is compared against all screeners and the lowest-rolling successful blocker is attacked. Characters can only screen against foes and attacks they could plausibly physically block.

Lock Shields
: **MA**
: ~~TODO~~

Shatter A Shield
: **MA**
: ~~TODO~~

Make an Opportunity Attack
: **IA**
