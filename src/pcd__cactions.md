# Combat Actions

[^1]:
  <!-- .abbreviations -->
  MA
  : Main Action

  MvA
  : Move Action

  OTA
  : On Turn Action

  IA
  : Instant Action


Cast a Spell
: **MA**

Charge
: **MvA** + **MA**
: Rush in straight line from at least 30ft (9m 6sq t) up to 60ft (18m 12sq tt) and hurl a spear or make a melee attack with a +2 attack roll bonus;
: -2 to AC for the whole combat round.

Disengage
: **MA**
: The character disengages from any melee opponents around them. They don't actually move away, but they can now move away (**MvA**) from the opponents without granting them an opportunity attack;
: If the character doesn't move, it might get re-engaged by the opponents.

Drop an Item
: **IA**
: The character drops an item they were holding. They can do it instantly to free up their hands.

Go Prone
: **OTA**
: The character falls flat, forcing a -2 penalty on the to hit roll of ranged attackers;
: Although adjacent melee and ranged opponents get a +2 to hit instead.

Go Total Defense [^1]
: **IA** + **MA**
: As an Instant Action (so even before their own turn), the character chooses to focus on avoiding anything hurled at them;
: It consumes the character Main Action;
: The character gains a +2 to their AC until their next turn;
: It is OK to decide to _Go Total Defense_ right after a foe has rolled their attack, thus potentially turning their hit into a miss.

~~Hold Action~~
: **MvA**
: The character foregoes their **MvA** to hold their action until later in the round;
: The remaining **MA** is triggered as an **IA** when the character wishes it;
: Held actions are resolved before other characters' impeding actions;
: See also `Take Action After`.

<!-- dl break -->

Make a Melee Attack
: **MA**
: Make a melee attack with a readied melee weapon, see previous page.

Make a Ranged Attack
: **MA**
: Make a ranged attack with a readied ranged weapon, see previous page.

Make an Opportunity Attack
: **IA**
: As a foe moves out of their melee reach, a character is granted an attack of opportunity, unless the foe is using _Disengage_.

Make a Snap Attack
: **IA** + **MA**
: The character decides to act immediately (before his turn), sacrificing accuracy for speed. They _Make a Melee Attack_ or _Make a Ranged Attack_ against a foe in range;
: The attack takes a -4 penalty to its hit roll.
: If multiple combatants decide to _Make a Snap Attack_ at the same time, they are resolved simultaneously;
: (if the character is a nameless NPC, the referee shouldn't bother granting them snap attacks).

Move
: **MvA**
: The character moves at their normal movement rate (30ft 9m 6sq t for a human);
: Halve the movement rate in case of difficult terrain or when progressing prone;
: Some terrains might even require a 1d20 + _Exert_ ≥ `STR TC` skill check or some other check success to secure even the half rate.

Pick Up An Item
: **MvA**
: The character scoops up an object off the floor if they have a free hand, leaving it readied in their grip.

Ready Or Stow An Item
: **MA**
: The character draws a weapon, extracts an item from their pack, or otherwise moves an object around on their person.

Reload A Weapon
: **MA**
: The character reloads a weapon like a crossbow with a quarrel from a readied quiver;
: Bows can be reloaded as an On Turn Action (**OTA**), assuming the character has a readied quiver and at least +1 for their particular weapon skill; otherwise it's a Move Action (**MvA**).

Screen An Ally
: **MvA**
: The character moves up to thier normal move rate towards an ally and then physically blocks opponents from attacking them, provided they remain adjacent;
: Until the character's next turn, foes wishing to make a melee or ranged attack against the screened ally must succeed 1d20 + _weapon skill_ ≥ screener `STR DC`;
: On failure, the screener will be the recipient of the attack and not the ally;
: In a round a screener can deflect a number of opponents equal to their weapon proficiency, thus a _Sword_ +2 character can block two attackers with their sword;
: A +0 weapon skill, doesn't let a character screen an ally with that weapon;
: Multiple characters can screen a common ally, requiring multiple rolls from the attackers.

Shatter A Shield
: **MA**
: An attacker using an axe or a heavy mace may attempt to shatter their opponent's shield;
: On a successful hit roll, an opposed 1d20 + `STR DC` ≥ 1d20 + target `STR DC` is rolled, in case of success the target's shield becomes unusable.

Stand Up
: **MvA**
: The character gets up from a prone position, gathering any dropped belongings if they so desire;
: Characters that have just come out of unconsciousness must get up before they do much else.

~~Take Action After~~
: **OTA**
: The character declares it will act **after** another participant has acted;
: Unlike `Hold Action`, the character cannot change their mind and act earlier;
: Unlike `Hold Action`, it doesn't consume a **MvA**.

Use A Skill
: **MA**
: The character uses a skill that could be plausibly applied in a few seconds.
: The referee will probably require a dice roll as the skill usage is attempted under pressure, under fire.

<!-- dl break -->

Lock Shields
: **MA**
: A character moves next to an ally and locks shield with them;
: A soon as 3 characters form this shield wall, they all gain +2 to their AC;
: The +2 is ignored by attacker in the back or on the right flank of the wall;
: The wall (and its +2) ends for participants without shields and it ends when only to defenders remain.
