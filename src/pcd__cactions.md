# Combat Actions

[^1]:
  <!-- .abbreviations -->
  MA
  : Main Action

  MvA
  : Move Action

  OTA
  : On Turn Action

  IA
  : Instant Action

Cast a Spell
: **MA**
: Cast a spell, with a free hand.

Delay an Action
: **OTA**
: Delay remainder of their actions until after a particular participant has acted.
: Unlike `Hold an Action`, you cannot choose to act earlier.

Hold an Action
: **MvA**
: By choosing to _Hold an Action_, the combatant can delay taking the rest of their actions until later in the round, activating them as an Instant Action.
: Thus, a character who wins the initiative might use their Move Action to _Hold and Action_. Later in the round, as an enemy rushes around a corner, he may Instantly elect to use his Main Action to _Make a Ranged Attack_ with his readied crossbow. If acting in response to someone else's impeding action, the held action is resolved first.

Foo
: **OTA**
: The combatant simply chooses to delay the remainder of their actions this turn until after a particular other participant has acted. Such a pause may be needed for some tactical plan or to respond to a particular enemy's action. Unlike `Hold an Action`, however, they cannot suddenly choose to act earlier than their chosen place in the turn order; they must wait until the participant they chose has acted before using whatever remaining actions they may have for the turn.
