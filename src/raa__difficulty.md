# Skill Check Difficulty

|      | Skill Check Difficulty |
|:----:|------------------------|
|   5- | (no check needed)      |
|   6  | A relatively simple task that is still more than the character would usually be expected to manage in their regular background |
|   8  | A significant challenge to a competent professional that they'd still succeed at more often than not |
|  10  | Something too difficult to be expected of anyone but an expert, and even they might fail |
|  12  | Only a true master could expect to carry this off with any degree of reliability |
|  14+ | Only a true master has any chance of achieving this at all, and even they will probably fail |

The referee might increase the difficulty by 1 or 2 if they think that the skill is not completely relevant to the check.

Circumstances and tools might alter a skill check difficulty. Usually the referee should limit the total change from -2 to +2.

## Probabilities

To put the above skill check difficulties in perspective, here are success percentages for roll versus difficulty pairs:

| 2d6 | DC 6 | DC 7 | DC 8 | DC 9 | DC 10 | DC 11 | DC 12 | DC 13 | DC 14 | DC 15 |
|-----|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| - 5 |  8.3 |  2.8 |  0.0 |  0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |
| - 4 | 16.7 |  8.3 |  2.8 |  0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |   0.0 |

| + 4 |  100 | 97.2 | 91.6 | 83.3 |  72.2 |  58.3 |  41.6 |  27.7 |  16.7 |   8.3 |
| + 5 |  100 |  100 | 97.2 | 91.6 |  83.3 |  72.2 |  58.3 |  41.6 |  27.7 |  16.7 |
| + 6 |  100 |  100 |  100 | 97.2 |  91.6 |  83.3 |  72.2 |  58.3 |  41.6 |  27.7 |

For example, a roll of 2d6+1 with a difficulty of 9 succeeds 41.6% of the time.

Here is a table about advantage (highest 2 of 3d6) and disadvantage (lowest 2 of 3d6) for skill checks:

| Target |   2d6   |    Adv  |  ~ |    Dis  |  ~ |
|-------:|--------:|--------:|---:|--------:|---:|
|      2 | 100.00% | 100.00% | +0 | 100.00% |  0 |
|      3 |  97.22% |  99.54% | +1 |  92.59% | -1 |
|      4 |  91.67% |  98.15% | +1 |  80.09% | -1 |
|      5 |  83.33% |  94.91% | +2 |  64.35% | -2 |
|      6 |  72.22% |  89.35% | +2 |  47.69% | -2 |
|      7 |  58.33% |  80.56% | +2 |  31.94% | -2 |
|      8 |  41.67% |  68.06% | +2 |  19.44% | -2 |
|      9 |  27.78% |  52.31% | +2 |  10.65% | -2 |
|     10 |  16.67% |  35.65% | +2 |   5.09% | -2 |
|     11 |   8.33% |  19.91% | +1 |   1.85% | -1 |
|     12 |   2.78% |   7.41% | +1 |   0.46% |  0 |

For example, a roll of 2d6+1 with a difficulty of 9 (target is 9 - 1 = 8), succeeds 41.67% of the time, with the advantage it becomes 68.06% (roughly equivalent to giving a +2), with the disadvantage it becomes 19.44% (roughly -2). These equivalent modifiers have to be taken with a pinch of salt.
