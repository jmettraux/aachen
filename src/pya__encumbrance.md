# Encumbrance

check
: happens before the party starts its movement;
: each player describes the load of their character(s);
: each character is flagged as _free_, _burdened_, or _very burdened_ by the referee (see _determine_);
: players may decide to _rebalance_.

rebalance
: takes at least 1 exploration turn (10 minutes);
: beware opponents interrupting the operation, place sentries;
: ends with a new _load check_.

<hr/>

scout [^1]
: a party may place one or more _free_ of burden scouts in front;
: their load being taken by others in the party;
: carriers and scouts are rotated during pauses.

pack
: mules and pack horses can each carry up to 240 lb (108 kg);
: they have to be harnessed and loaded carefully;
: they have to be fed properly and given appropriate rest;
: at least one character must be skilled in handling such animals.

<hr/>

drop
: a character may drop its load before fighting to become _free_ or, at least, _burdened_;
: it is an Instant Action **IA**;
: beware breaking gear;
: beware tripping on dropped gear;
: beware losing dropped gear in case of retreat.

<hr/>

determine
: using common sense; or
: strength `STR DC`; or
: (`STR DC` + `CON DC`) / 2; or
: an average `STR DC` of 10.5.

strength
: _free_ < (`DC` * 4 lb) < _burdened_ < (`DC` * 6 lb) < _very burdened_.

average
: `STR DC` of 10.5; thus
: _free_ < 42 lb < _burdened_ < 63 lb < _very burdened_.

<hr/>

free
: normal movement, 30ft 9m 6sq t.

burdened
: slowed movement, 20ft 6m 4sq;
: opponents get advantage in melee attacks.

very burdened
: slowed movement, 10ft 3m 2sq;
: opponents get advantage in melee attacks;
: disadvantage on all checks.
