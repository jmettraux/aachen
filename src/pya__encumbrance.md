# Encumbrance

before
: the party starts its move;
: a fight, after the characters _drop_ some of their load.

load check
: each player describes the load of their character(s);
: the referee flags each character as _free_, _burdened_, or _very burdened_;
: players may decide to _rebalance_.

rebalance
: takes at least 1 exploration turn (10 minutes);
: beware opponents interrupting the operation, place sentries;
: ends with a new _load check_.

drop
: a character may drop its load before a combat to become _free_ or, at least, _burdened_;
: is an Instant Action **IA**;
: beware breaking items;
: beware tripping on dropped gear;
: beware losing gear in case of retreat.

<hr/>

use
: common sense; or
: strength `STR DC`, or the mean between `STR DC` and `CON DC`; or
: an average `STR DC` of 10.5.

strength
: below `STR DC` * 4 lb, a character is _free_;
: below `STR DC` * 6 lb, a character is _burdened_;
: else, the character is _very burdened_;

average
: `STR DC` of 10.5, thus _free_ < 42 lb < _burdened_ < 63 lb < _very burdened_.

<hr/>

free
: normal movement, 30ft 9m 6sq t.

burdened
: slowed movement, 20ft 6m 4sq;
: opponents get advantage in melee attacks.

very burdened
: slowed movement, 10ft 3m 2sq;
: opponents get advantage in melee attacks;
: disadvantage on all checks.

## packing

## voltigeur

* no backpacks
* bundles
* furcas

* before a march, the referee calls for a round of table and each player describes their character or characters' load
* the referee flags each character as free, hindered, or burdened
* the characters may shuffle their loads
* having one or two less encumbered characters in front might be a good thing
* having porters, mules, or pack horses is a good idea

**TODO** add traits for better resistance to encumbrance
