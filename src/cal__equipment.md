# equip

The referee grants equipment to the character, according to their background, origin, and class.

The equipment list below give values for common items of good quality. The monetary system used is the Pound - Shilling - Pence system. Values are expressed in minimum coins and also in pence.

Please remember that coins are rare and mostly used with outsiders, people that can't be trusted, but the value of items is still known in coins.

Item prices are indicative, hence most of them are expressed in pounds or shilling.

Two easy points of reference, a labourer expects to be paid 1 penny for a day of work and a cow costs 8 shillings (96 pence), hence 96 days of labour.
