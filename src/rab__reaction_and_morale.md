# Reaction

When the adventuring party encounters one or more creatures or NPCs, the referee might want to determine randomly what their reaction is. He rolls 2d6 and consult the table above.

Of course, if the opponents are ambushing the party, a reaction roll is not needed.

The reaction roll result has to be adapted to the situation. A 12 reaction with a band of thug might mean that they don't want to take the life of the party and are happy to let them go for a light fee.

## Social Encounter Reaction

TODO

<!--
A reaction roll determines the reaction of another party upon meeting the player characters.

That other party may be a single creature or a group of them.

A referee may choose to bypass the reaction roll if he judges the situation doesn't call for it. The other party might be ambushing the player characters.
Players might throw aside a reaction roll by deciding to attack.

The reaction is determined by rolling 2d6 and consulting the table below.

If a character leads and greets the other party, add the character's CHA modifier to the reaction roll.

The higher the roll, the friendlier the disposition.

A reaction roll is done against a background situation. A roll of 12 for a band of thugs that encircled the party might indicate they're willing to let them go for a simple bribe, not that they're throwing themselves in the arms of the player characters and declaring eternal friendship.

A high reaction roll combined with some caution on the part of the player characters might turn the combat into a parley and potentially avoid fight altogether.

Reaction rolls may be used for social encounters as well. The player characters might be presenting a request to a local magistrate and the referee rolls 2d6 plus the party leader's CHA modifier to get a feel for the magistrate mood.

# Morale

Morale affect NPCs, not PCs. By default, NPCs fight as long as honor and common sense demand it, but failed morale checks may change that.

Morale checks are done

* the first time the NPCs sees an ally downed,
* when the NPCs sees half their allies downed

The referee rolls a 2d6 for the NPCs, if the result is higher (> not ≥) than its morale number, the NPCs must retreat or surrender, at the referee's discretion.

The referee may decide on a modifier from -2 to +2 given circumstances like the presence of the leader (for example goblins have a morale of 7 usually, but it becomes 9 in presence of their leader).
