# Reaction

When the adventuring party encounters one or more creatures or NPCs, the referee might want to determine randomly what this opposition's reaction is. He rolls 2d6 and consult the table above.

If the opposition is ambushing the party, a reaction roll is not needed (determining the if the adventuring party is surprised is needed).

The reaction roll result has to be adapted to the situation. A 12 reaction with a band of thug might mean that they don't want to take the life of the party and are happy to let them go for a light fee.

A high reaction roll combined with some caution on the part of the player characters might turn the combat into a parley and potentially avoid fight altogether.

## Social Encounter Reaction

Reaction rolls may be used for social encounters as well. The player characters might be presenting a request to a local magistrate and the referee rolls 2d6 plus the party's spokesperson `CHA` modifier.

# Morale

Morale affects NPCs, not PCs. By default, NPCs fight as long as honor and common sense demand it, but failed morale checks may change that.

Morale checks are done

<!-- .morale-checks -->
* the first time the NPCs sees an ally downed,
* when the NPCs sees half their allies downed

The referee rolls a 2d6 for the NPCs, if the result is higher (> not ≥) than its morale number, the NPCs must retreat or surrender, at the referee's discretion.

The referee may decide on a modifier from -2 to +2 given circumstances like the presence of the leader (for example, goblins have a morale of 7 usually, but it becomes 9 in presence of their leader).
