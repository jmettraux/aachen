# Skill Checks

~~2d6 + _skill level_ + _attribute modifier_~~ is the formula for a skill check. It succeeds if the sum is greater or equal to a _difficulty class_ (DC) set by the referee. The _attribute modifier_ is determined by the referee.

For example, to force a door open, the referee might demand a `STR`/`Exert` check and set the DC to 8. A character with a `STR` of 17 and an `Exert` of 1, thus rolls 2d6 + 1 (`Exert`) + 1 (`STR`m) against 8.

If a character has no level in the skill being challenged, then -1 is used (remember 0 is the starting level, _ordinary practicioner_). The example becomes 2d6 -1 (no level in `Exert`) + 1 (`STR`m) against 8.

## Dis-Advantage

The referee might grant advantage or require disadvantage on a skill check. In case of advantage, 3d6 are rolled and the best two are kept and summed. In case of disadvantage, 3d6 are rolled and the worse two are kept and summed.
