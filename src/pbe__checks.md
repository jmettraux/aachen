# Skill Checks

~~2d6 + _skill level_ + _attribute modifier_~~ is rolled as a skill check. It succeeds if the sum is greater or equal to a _difficulty class_ (DC) set by the referee. The _attribute modifier_ is determined by the referee.

For example, to force a door open, the referee might demand a `STR`/`Exert` check and set the DC to 8. A character with a `STR` of 17 and an `Exert` of 1, thus rolls 2d6 + 1 (`Exert`) + 1 (`STR`m) against 8.

If a character has no level in the skill being challenged, then -1 is used (remember 0 is the starting level, _ordinary practicioner_). The example becomes 2d6 -1 (no level in `Exert`) + 1 (`STR`m) against 8.

The referee determines when a skill check is required or not. When there is no time pressure, a dice roll might not be necessary and the referee will simply consider the skill level and the difficulty class and grant success or not.

## Dis-Advantage

The referee might grant advantage or require disadvantage on a skill check. In case of advantage, 3d6 are rolled and the best two are kept and summed. In case of disadvantage, 3d6 are rolled and the worse two are kept and summed.

## Aiding a Check

A character may help another character at a skill check if the referee agrees. The helper rolls with the same skill against the same difficulty class. The attribute modifier might be different, as the referee sees fit. If the help check suceeds the helped check gains a +1. Multiple characters may help a check, but the maximum bonus is +1.

## Opposed Checks

Skill checks may be opposed, the highest wins. The same combination _attribute_ / _skill_ may be used on both side, or not. Break a tie by rolling again or comparing raw _skill levels_.

For example, a `STR`/`Exert` can be used as a contest of strength, while a scout may roll `DEX`/`Sneak` against a sentinel's `WIS`/`Notice`.
