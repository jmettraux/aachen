# Skill Checks

Aachen checks are all 1d20 + modifiers ≥ `TC` (target class). The referee decides what `TC` and what modifiers do apply. The modifier is the skill level of the character (or -2 if the character is unskilled).

A skill check is generally done when there is time pressure or opposition. Else the referee might grant success given a certain skill. For example, the referee might decide that a character with `+0` in _Reading_ can easily read a certain text.

Here are a few examples of skill check adjudications:

Sneaking
: 1d20 + _Scout_ ≥ `EVA TC` ~~or~~
: 1d20 + _Scout_ ≥ opponent's 1d20 + _Spy_ ~~or~~
: 1d20 + _Scout_ ≥ opponent's `WIS` (**not** `WIS TC`) ~~or~~
: 1d20 + _Scout_ ≥ static `DC`

Obtaining a discount
: 1d20 + _Trade_ ≥ `INT TC` ~~or~~
: 1d20 + _Trade_ ≥ `WIS TC` ~~or~~
: 1d20 + _Trade_ ≥ opponent's 1d20 + _Trade_

Shooting at the range
: 1d20 + _Bows_ ≥ `DEX TC`

Healing a character
: 1d20 + _Heal_ ≥ `INT TC` ~~or~~
: 1d20 + _Heal_ ≥ wounded's `CON TC`

In summary:

Against own's TC
: 1d20 + Skill ≥ Ability `TC` ~~or~~
: 1d20 + Skill ≥ Save `TC`

Against friend's TC
: 1d20 + Skill ≥ friend's Ability `TC` ~~or~~
: 1d20 + Skill ≥ friend's Save `TC`

Opposed check
: 1d20 + Skill ≥ opponent's 1d20 + Skill ~~or~~
: 1d20 + Skill ≥ opponent's 1d20 + other Skill ~~or~~
: 1d20 + Skill ≥ opponent's Ability (**not** abi `TC`)

Arbitrary DC
: 1d20 + Skill ≥ arbitrary DC (Difficulty Class)

## Dis-Advantage

The referee might grant advantage or disadvantage on a skill check. Two d20s are rolled and the highest is kept in case of advantage (the lowest for a disadvantage).

## Aiding a Check

A character may help the skill check of another character. The helper rolls like the helped will roll. If the helper succeeds, the helped gains a `+2` on their roll. More people may help but the max help bonus stays at `+2`.
