# Determine Hit Points

The class table determines the hit points for the character. The `CON` modifier has to be added. A `Fighter` with a `CON` of 17 thus has to roll 1d6+2 + 1 to determine their max hit points (for now at level 1).[^1]

A character must have at least 1 as a hit point maximum. They cannot have a maximum hit points of 0 or -1.

[^1]:
  Option:<br/>a level 1 character gets the best possible roll, the example `Fighter` thus gets 9 HP
