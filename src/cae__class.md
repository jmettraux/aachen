# Select a Class

There are only three core classes, `Fighter`, `Dabster`, and `Caster`, but they can be mixed in pairs (three plus three classes in total).

The vast majority of people belong to the classes `Fighter` and `Dabster`.

Adventurers are probably travellers, pilgrims, traders, vagabonds, gyrovagues, or hired hands on a mission. One who wields a spear is probably a fighter, you'd have to see them fight to ascertain that, the man with a tonsure is a cleric, or someone posing as one.

Each class is presented with a table detailing how many HPs (and maybe CPs) and skills they receive each time they level up. Character creation is considered as levelling up from 0 to 1.

Each item in a class table has a `TC` covering it. A successful 1d20 roll against this `TC` grants the advantage on the roll below. For example. A fighter succeeding a `CON TC` roll, then rolls (best of 2 d8)+3 instead of 1d8+3 to add to their HP count.

<!--
A class is also given two class talents and one free talent to select (two free talents for a `Dabster`). A talent is a qualifier that comes in two levels: unprefixed and _very_-prefixed. The two class talents are already _very_-prefixed.

## Fighter

Any free man is supposed to bear arms in service of his community. Better if he has some actual training in using them.

Choosing the `Fighter` class doesn't mean the character is a professional soldier, it means they have an aptitude for weapons and are devoting time to maintain and enhance that aptitude.

The `Fighter` class talents are `VERY SWERVING` and `VERY FIRM`.


| Item           | 1d20 ≥   | Count      |
|:--------------:|:--------:|:----------:|
| HP             | `CON TC` | 1d8        |
| CP             |          |            |
| Fighter Skills | `Lea TC` | 1d3        |
| General Skills | `Lea TC` | 1d6        |
| Magic Skills   |          |            |
| Traits         |          | 2 attempts |

## Dabster

One who is skilled, proficient. Thief, diplomat, healer, scholar, explorer, priest, artisan, ...

Dabsters gain the widest variety of non-combat skills and are the quickest to learn more of them.

The `Dabster` class talents are `VERY SKILLFUL` and `VERY EVASIVE`.

## Caster

At some point during their childhood, the `Caster`'s gift was revealed and they understood they were different and had to conceal that difference.

Some of them are very talented, some others less so but were lucky enough to find someone whose trail they could walk in.

A `Caster` has `VERY INTRICATE` and `VERY WISE` as class talents.


# _or a_ Hybrid _of_ two Classes

`Fighter`, `Dabster`, and `Caster` are meant to cover a wide range of characters, but sometimes more granularity is required. A mix has its own level progression table, but the player has to choose between the class talents or halves of them.

For example, a `Fighter-Caster` has to choose between the class talents of the `Fighter` and of the `Caster`. The player can chose `VERY SWERVING` and `VERY INTRICATE`, or he could split the talents and take `VERY INTRICATE`, `SWERVING` and `FIRM` (1 very equals 2 non-very talents).
