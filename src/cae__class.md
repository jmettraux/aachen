# Select a Class

There are only three core classes, `Fighter`, `Dabster`, and `Caster`, but they can be mixed in pairs (three plus three classes in total).

The vast majority of people belong to the classes `Fighter` and `Dabster`.

Adventurers are probably travellers, pilgrims, traders, vagabonds, gyrovagues, or hired hands on a mission. One who wields a spear is probably a fighter, you'd have to see them fight to ascertain that, the man with a tonsure is a cleric, or someone posing as one.

Each class is presented with a table detailing the count of each item an adventurer get upon levelling up. Character creation counts as levelling up (to 1st level).

Before rolling for count, roll a d20 against the given `TC`, if successful then the count dice is rolled twice with the best result kept (like when rolling with advantage). For example, a fighter successfully rolling 1d20 against their `CON TC` may roll 2d8 pick the best and add 3 to determine their new HP max.

Traits are a bit different. A character receives _attempts_, they can be used to acquire a trait or to enhance it (from _regular_, to _very_, to _highly_).


| Item           | 1d20 ≥   | Count      |
|:--------------:|:--------:|:----------:|
| HP             | `CON TC` | 1d8+3      |
| CP             |          |            |
| Fighter Skills | `Lea TC` | 1d4        |
| General Skills | `Lea TC` | 1d4        |
| Magic Skills   |          |            |
| Spells         |          |            |
| Traits         |          | 3 attempts |

## Fighter

Any free man is supposed to bear arms in service of his community. Better if he has some actual training in using them.

Choosing the `Fighter` class doesn't mean the character is a professional soldier, it means they have an aptitude for weapons and are devoting time to maintain and enhance that aptitude.


| Item           | 1d20 ≥   | Count      |
|:--------------:|:--------:|:----------:|
| HP             | `CON TC` | 1d8        |
| CP             |          |            |
| Fighter Skills | `Lea TC` | 1d3        |
| General Skills | `Lea TC` | 1d6        |
| Magic Skills   |          |            |
| Spells         |          |            |
| Traits         |          | 3 attempts |

## Dabster

One who is skilled, proficient. Thief, diplomat, healer, scholar, explorer, priest, artisan, ...

Dabsters gain the widest variety of non-combat skills and are the quickest to learn more of them.

## Caster

At some point during their childhood, the `Caster`'s gift was revealed and they understood they were different and had to conceal that difference.

Some of them are very talented, some others less so but were lucky enough to find someone whose trail they could walk in.


# _or a_ Hybrid _of_ two Classes

Blah blah blah ~~TODO~~.

<!--
`Fighter`, `Dabster`, and `Caster` are meant to cover a wide range of characters, but sometimes more granularity is required. A mix has its own level progression table, but the player has to choose between the class talents or halves of them.

For example, a `Fighter-Caster` has to choose between the class talents of the `Fighter` and of the `Caster`. The player can chose `VERY SWERVING` and `VERY INTRICATE`, or he could split the talents and take `VERY INTRICATE`, `SWERVING` and `FIRM` (1 very equals 2 non-very talents).
