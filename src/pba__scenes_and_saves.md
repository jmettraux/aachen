# Scenes, Rounds, and Turns

A **scene** is usually a single time span in a single location. Most of scenes don't last longer than fifteen minutes. Examples of scenes are characters talking to NPCs to get information, or combat scenes.

Many power and abilities are limited to a scene and end as the scene ends.

A **round** is usually understood as a **combat round**, it covers roughly 6 seconds of a combat scene.

A **turn** is short for **exploration turn**, it covers 10 minutes of site exploration (underground location, ruins, etc). It's used for encounter frequency, rest requirements (5 exploration turns then 1 rest turn), and resource management (for example, a torch lasts for 3 turns).


# Saving Throws

Saving throws (or _saves_) are last-ditch attempt at avoiding unusual perils and dangers. Characters don't get a save to avoid or parry a sword stroke, that's determined by their armor class (AC) and the attack roll of the adversary.

The referee grants save rolls to characters and creatures, they get assigned a Target `TC` and a modifier:

Skill based
: 1d20 + Skill ≥ Save `TC`

Level based
: 1d20 + Level ≥ Save `TC`

Misfortune based
: 1d20 + 0 ≥ Save `TC`

&nbsp;

Physical Save
: When resisting a poison, a disease, or exhaustion.

Evasion Save
: Diving and dodging from sudden explosions, pits, and perils.

Mental Save
: When resisting magical effects, illusions, or warding off tempations and affirming one's willpower.

For example:

* 1d20 + _Feel_ ≥ `Men TC` for a `Caster` to detect and prevent a magical effect
* 1d20 + _Notice_ ≥ `Eva TC` for a character to dodge an arrow trap
* 1d20 + Level ≥ `Phy TC` to lower the effect of a poison
* 1d20 + 0 ≥ `Men TC` 
* ...

A saving throw is a kind of skill check against a save `TC`. The referee might grant advantage or disadvantage as well.

<!--
The modifier might be the character level, or a skill like _Exert_, _Pray_, _Feel_, _Notice_, etc. Like the Save TC it is determined by the referee, but player suggestions are welcome. The referee might also decide that a modifier is not applicable (+0).

The description of the power or ability being saved against generally dictates the effect of a successful save (effect nullified or attenuated).

A save roll may be considered a skill check against a save `TC`.
