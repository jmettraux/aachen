# Scenes, Rounds, and Turns

A **scene** is usually a single time span in a single location. Most of scenes don't last longer than fifteen minutes. Examples of scenes are characters talking to NPCs to get information, or combat scenes.

Many power and abilities are limited to a scene and end as the scene ends.

A **round** is usually understood as a **combat round**, it covers roughly 6 seconds of a combat scene.

A **turn** is short for **exploration turn**, it covers 10 minutes of site exploration (underground location, ruins, etc). It's used for encounter frequency, rest requirements (5 exploration turns then 1 rest turn), and resource management (for example, a torch lasts for 3 turns).


# Saving Throws

Saving throws (or _saves_) are last-ditch attempt at avoiding unusual perils and dangers. Characters don't get a save to avoid or parry a sword stroke, that's determined by their armor class (AC) and the attack roll of the adversary.

The referee grants saves to characters and creatures. They roll 1d20 and if the result is greater or equal to the save score, the save is successful.

Physical (Resistance) Save
: When resisting a poison, a disease, or exhaustion.
: score  → 16 - (max(`STR`m, `CON`m)) - _char level_

Mental (Resistance) Save
: When resisting magical effects, illusions, or warding off tempations and affirming one's willpower.
: score  → 16 - (max(`WIS`m, `CHA`m)) - _char level_

Evasion ( / Dodge) Save
: Diving and dodging from sudden explosions, pits, and perils.
: score  → 16 - (max(`DEX`m, `INT`m)) - _char level_

(Sheer) Luck Save
: When only sheer good luck can save the character.
: score  → 16 - _char level_

The description of the power or ability being saved against generally dictates the effect of a successful save (effect nullified or attenuated).

<!--
A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to resist magic, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. Referees request saving throws from characters under an imminent threat or resisting an effect.[^1]

A saving throw is done with a d20. It succeeds if equal or greater than the saving throw score.

A successful saving throw means that the character suffers no harm, or reduced harm.

Saving throws are computed from 16 minus the best of two attribute modifiers minus the character level.

[^1]:
  Note that saving are meant to be last-ditch chances to avoid the worst of
  unusual perils or uncommon dangers. You can't make an Evasion saving throw to
  dodge a sword stroke; that's what the hit roll is for. It's up to the referee
  to decide whether a particular danger might allow a saving throw or not.

## The Saves

The saving throws are:

* Physical (Resistance) Save
* Mental (Resistance) Save
* Evasion ( / Dodge) Save
* (Sheer) Luck Save

### Physical Saves

A physical resistance save. The referee may request a physical saving throw to determine how a character resists a poison, a disease, or exhaustion.

### Mental Saves

A mental resistance save. The referee may request mental saving throws against magical effect, illusions, or to ward off tempations and ascertain a character's willpower.

### Evasion Saves

An evasion save. Diving and dodging from sudden explosions, pits, and perils, when swiftness and reaction speed are challenged.

### Luck Saves

Luck saves are not rooted in any attribute. When sheer good luck is the last ditch defense.
