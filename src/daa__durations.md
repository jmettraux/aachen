# Durations, Scenes, Rounds, And Turns

The referee is expected to track time for adventures and campaigns. Faery tales of endless winters have been told and retold but they too have some kind of calendar that the referee must track.

The adventuring party might have stopped at a farmstead and be helping for the harvest in exchange for food and sleeping in the barn, staying for a whole five days. That has to be kept track of.

At a finer level of granularity, keeping track of how much time is required to perform tasks and how long do effects, magical or other, do last is necessary.

Most effects do last for a **scene**. A single fight is a scene, a dialog with a NPC is a scene. A single time span in a single location. The majority of scenes last no longer than a quarter of an hour. When an power or ability listed as "lasting for a scene" is used in one scene, it's expected to be over at the beginning of the next scene, unless decided otherwise by the referee.

During a fight (scene), the time is divided in **rounds** of six seconds.

In the heat of the combat, __turn__ is often used interchangeably with __round__. That is why, __exploration turn__ is distinguished below. On some tables, a __combat turn__ is understood as the span of time where the focus, the turn is given to a creature in combat. A __round__ is thus a sum of __combat turns__, taken, well, in turn.

Some effects and combat moves work on the distinction between the whole __round__ and the smaller __combat turn__. Examples shall be provided to avoid confusion.

An **exploration turn** is used when exploring sites and ruins. One exploration turn lasts ten minutes. It's used for encounter frequency, rest requirement, and resource management, for example, a torch lasts for three exploration turns.
