# Morale

Rules for the referee about NPCs morale.

## Morale Checks

Morale affect NPCs, not PCs. By default, NPCs fight as long as honor and common sense demand it, but failed morale checks may change that.

Morale checks are done

* the first time the NPC sees an ally downed,
* when the NPC sees half their allies downed

The referee rolls a 2d6 for the NPC, if the result is higher than its morale number, the NPC must retreat or surrender, at the referee's discretion.

The referee may decide on a modifier from -2 to +2 given circumstances like the presence of the leader (for example goblins have a morale of 7 usually, but it becomes 9 in presence of their leader).
