# Spells

Casters see the magical energy as threads of various colours. Each colour affects different _domains_. It is probable that some casters see colours differently, and that some of them don't see some of the colours.

Most of the casters choose simple, well known, forms for weaving their magical threads. Maybe in Byzantium or furhter east, there are casters that know more complicated forms.
