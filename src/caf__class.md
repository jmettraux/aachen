# Select Class

There are only three core classes, `Fighter`, `Dabster`, and `Caster`, but they can be mixed in pairs (three plus three classes in total). Each class has two abilities, prefixed with ❦ _fleurons_.

Adventurers are probably travellers, pilgrims, traders, vagabonds, gyrovagues, or hired hands on a mission. One who wields a spear is probably a fighter, you'd have to see them fight to ascertain that, the man with a tonsure is a cleric, or someone posing as one.

There should probably be no more than one `Caster` per adventurer group. It's a difficult class to play, it's weaker and must hide its abilities constantly from others.

A party composed only of `Fighter` characters is acceptable, but having one or two `Dabster` characters is probably better.

The number of classes is limited, but not your imagination, and experience will forge the characters gradually.

## Fighter

Any free man is supposed to bear arms in service of his community. Better if he has some actual training in using them.

Choosing the `Fighter` class doesn't mean the character is a professional soldier, it means they have an aptitude for weapons and are devoting time to maintain and enhance that aptitude.

### ❦ Swerving

Once per scene, as an instant action, a successful attack roll against the character can be negated or the character missed attack roll can be made to hit.

This ability cannot be used to negate an attack targetting a vehicle or creature the character is riding. It cannot be used to negate damage inflicted by the "environment" the character is in.

### ❦ FIXME

TODO

<!--
 All heroes can pick one Focus, but Warriors may pick two, either taking two different Foci at first level or taking two
levels of a single favored art.

A Fighter can pick two Talents at level 1, or pick one Talent at level 2. (Other character classes pick only one Talent at level 1).

## Dabster

One who is skilled, proficient. Thief, diplomat, healer, scholar, explorer, priest, artisan, ...

Dabsters gain the widest variety of non-combat skills and are the quickest to learn more of them.

### ❦ Rerolling

Once per scene, the `Dabster` may reroll any non-combat skill check as an Instant action.

In cases where it matters, the better of the two rolls may be used.

### ❦ Assimilating

Upon advancing in experience level, the Dabster gains a bonus skill point that can be used on any non-combat, non-magic skill. This point can be saved for later use.

See the section on _Advancement_ for how it plays out.

## Caster

At some point during their childhood, the `Caster`'s gift was revealed and they understood they were different and had to conceal that difference.

Some of them are very talented, some others less so but were lucky enough to find someone whose trail they could walk in.

### ❦ Obfuscating

Once per scene, a missed _Sneak_ or _Convince_ skill check can be turned into a success.

`Caster`s spends most of their life hiding their abilities. They are used to cover up, deny, conceal, etc.

### ❦ Spellcasting

The `Caster` gains one level in _Cast_ and can weave the thread of magic to cast spells.

See the spellcasting section for more.

## Mixing two core classes

Fighter, Dabster, and Caster are meant to cover a wide range of characters, but sometimes more granularity is required. An Adventurer is a mix of two classes, not as strong as a "pure" class, but more versatile.

## Dabster-Fighter

A partial Dabster has the _quick learner_ class ability but not the _expertise_ one.

A partial Fighter doesn't have the _fighter's luck_ class ability but still receives their extra Talent.

A partial Dabster / partial Fighter attack bonuses progress less advantageously than for a pure Fighter, but the hit points progress is equivalent.

## Dabster-Caster

A partial Dabster has the _quick learner_ class ability but not the _expertise_ one.

A partial Caster must choose between Sneak or Convince, they cannot benefit from both like a pure Caster does. Furthermore, a partial Caster disposes of less weave points, thus can cast less spells.

A partial Caster must choose between Sneak or Convince, they cannot benefit from both like a pure Caster does. Furthermore, a partial Caster disposes of less weave points, thus can cast less spells.

A partial Fighter doesn't have the _fighter's luck_ class ability but still receives their extra Talent.
