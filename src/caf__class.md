# Select Class

There are only three core classes, Fighter, Expert, and Weaver (spellcaster). There is a fourth possibility, Adventurer which mixes two classes.


## Fighter

People gifted for physical violence and tenacity. Or simply any free man.

| Level | Hit Points | Attack | Talent Picks      |
|------:|-----------:|-------:|:-----------------:|
|     1 |      1d6+2 |     +1 | 1 Any + 1 Fighter |
|     2 |      2d6+4 |     +2 | +1 Any            |
|     3 |      3d6+6 |     +3 |                   |
|     4 |      4d6+8 |     +4 |                   |
|     5 |     5d6+10 |     +5 | +1 Any            |
|     6 |     6d6+12 |     +6 |                   |
|     7 |     7d6+14 |     +7 | +1 Any            |
|     8 |     8d6+16 |     +8 |                   |
|     9 |     9d6+18 |     +9 |                   |
|    10 |    10d6+20 |    +10 | +1 Any            |

### Class Ability: Fighter's Luck

Once per scene, as an instant action, a successful attack roll against the character can be negated or the Fighter missed attack roll can be made into a successful hit.

This ability cannot be used to negate environmental damage or damage done to a vehicule or mount the Fighter is riding.

### Class Ability: Extra Talent

A Fighter can pick two Talents at level 1, or pick one Talent at level 2. (Other character classes pick only one Talent at level 1).


## Expert

Thief, diplomat, healer, scholar, explorer, artisan can be enacted by a character with the expert class.

Experts gain the widest variety of non-combat skills and are the quickest to learn more of them.

| Level | Hit Points | Attack | Talent Picks     |
|------:|-----------:|-------:|:----------------:|
|     1 |        1d6 |     +0 | 1 Any + 1 Expert |
|     2 |        2d6 |     +1 | +1 Any           |
|     3 |        3d6 |     +1 |                  |
|     4 |        4d6 |     +2 |                  |
|     5 |        5d6 |     +2 | +1 Any           |
|     6 |        6d6 |     +3 |                  |
|     7 |        7d6 |     +3 | +1 Any           |
|     8 |        8d6 |     +4 |                  |
|     9 |        9d6 |     +4 |                  |
|    10 |       10d6 |     +5 | +1 Any           |

### Class Ability: Expertise

Once per scene, the Expert may reroll any non-combat skill check as an Instant action.

In cases where it matters, the better of the two rolls may be used.

### Class Ability: Quick Learner

Upon advancing in experience level, the Expert gains a bonus skill point that can be used on any non-combat, non-magic skill. This point can be saved for later use.


## Weaver

Weavers can weave the threads of the source. That gift grew in them since childhood, they learned how to hide it and how to use it without getting noticed.

| Level | Hit Points | Attack | Talent Picks |
|------:|-----------:|-------:|:------------:|
|     1 |      1d6-1 |     +0 | 1 Any        |
|     2 |      2d6-2 |     +0 | +1 Any       |
|     3 |      3d6-3 |     +1 |              |
|     4 |      4d6-4 |     +1 |              |
|     5 |      5d6-5 |     +2 | +1 Any       |
|     6 |      6d6-6 |     +2 |              |
|     7 |      7d6-7 |     +3 | +1 Any       |
|     8 |      8d6-8 |     +3 |              |
|     9 |      9d6-9 |     +3 |              |
|    10 |    10d6-10 |     +4 | +1 Any       |

### Class Ability: Sneak And Convince

The Weaver gains one level in Sneak and one in Convince.

But remember, no novice character skill level can exceed 1.

### Class Ability: Spellcasting

The Weaver gains one level in Cast.

See the magic section for weaver and spellcasting.


## Adventurer

Fighter, Expert, and Weaver are meant to cover a wide range of characters, but sometimes more granularity is required. An Adventurer is a mix of two classes, not as strong as a "pure" class, but more versatile.

### Partial Expert / Partial Fighter

A partial Expert has the _quick learner_ class ability but not the _expertise_ one.

A partial Fighter doesn't have the _fighter's luck_ class ability but still receives their extra Talent.

A partial Expert / partial Fighter attack bonuses progress less advantageously than for a pure Fighter, but the hit points progress is equivalent.

| Level | Hit Points | Attack | Talent Picks                 |
|------:|-----------:|-------:|:----------------------------:|
|     1 |      1d6+2 |     +1 | 1 Expert + 1 Fighter + 1 Any |
|     2 |      2d6+4 |     +2 | +1 Any                       |
|     3 |      3d6+6 |     +2 |                              |
|     4 |      4d6+8 |     +3 |                              |
|     5 |     5d6+10 |     +4 | +1 Any                       |
|     6 |     6d6+12 |     +5 |                              |
|     7 |     7d6+14 |     +5 | +1 Any                       |
|     8 |     8d6+16 |     +6 |                              |
|     9 |     9d6+18 |     +6 |                              |
|    10 |    10d6+20 |     +7 | +1 Any                       |

### Partial Expert / Partial Weaver

A partial Expert has the _quick learner_ class ability but not the _expertise_ one.

A partial Weaver must choose between Sneak or Convince, they cannot benefit from both like a pure Weaver does. Furthermore, a partial Weaver disposes of less weave points, thus can cast less spells.

| Level | Hit Points | Attack | Talent Picks     |
|------:|-----------:|-------:|:----------------:|
|     1 |        1d6 |     +0 | 1 Expert + 1 Any |
|     2 |        2d6 |     +1 | +1 Any           |
|     3 |        3d6 |     +1 |                  |
|     4 |        4d6 |     +2 |                  |
|     5 |        5d6 |     +2 | +1 Any           |
|     6 |        6d6 |     +3 |                  |
|     7 |        7d6 |     +3 | +1 Any           |
|     8 |        8d6 |     +4 |                  |
|     9 |        9d6 |     +4 |                  |
|    10 |       10d6 |     +5 | +1 Any           |

### Partial Weaver / Partial Fighter

A partial Weaver must choose between Sneak or Convince, they cannot benefit from both like a pure Weaver does. Furthermore, a partial Weaver disposes of less weave points, thus can cast less spells.

A partial Fighter doesn't have the _fighter's luck_ class ability but still receives their extra Talent.

| Level | Hit Points | Attack | Talent Picks      |
|------:|-----------:|-------:|:-----------------:|
|     1 |      1d6+2 |     +1 | 1 Fighter + 1 Any |
|     2 |      2d6+4 |     +2 | +1 Any            |
|     3 |      3d6+6 |     +2 |                   |
|     4 |      4d6+8 |     +3 |                   |
|     5 |     5d6+10 |     +4 | +1 Any            |
|     6 |     6d6+12 |     +5 |                   |
|     7 |     7d6+14 |     +5 | +1 Any            |
|     8 |     8d6+16 |     +6 |                   |
|     9 |     9d6+18 |     +6 |                   |
|    10 |    10d6+20 |     +7 | +1 Any            |
