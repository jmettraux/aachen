# Select Class

There are only three core classes, `Fighter`, `Dabster`, and `Caster`, but they can be mixed in pairs (three plus three classes in total).

Adventurers are probably travellers, pilgrims, traders, vagabonds, gyrovagues, or hired hands on a mission. One who wields a spear is probably a fighter, you'd have to see them fight to ascertain that, the man with a tonsure is a cleric, or someone posing as one.

There should probably be no more than one `Caster` per adventurer group. It's a difficult class to play, it's weaker and must hide its abilities constantly from others.

A party composed only of `Fighter` characters is acceptable, but having one or two `Dabster` characters is probably better.

The number of classes is limited, but not your imagination, and experience will forge the characters gradually.

## Fighter

Any free man is supposed to bear arms in service of his community. Better if he has some actual training in using them.

Choosing the `Fighter` class doesn't mean the character is a professional soldier, it means they have an aptitude for weapons and are devoting time to maintain and enhance that aptitude.

### Ability: Fighter's Luck

Once per scene, as an instant action, a successful attack roll against the character can be negated or the character missed attack roll can be made to hit.

This ability cannot be used to negate an attack on a vehicle or creature the character is riding. It cannot be used to negate damage inflicted by the "environment" the character is in.

### Ability: Extra Talent

<!--
 All heroes can pick one Focus, but Warriors may pick two, either taking two different Foci at first level or taking two
levels of a single favored art.

A Fighter can pick two Talents at level 1, or pick one Talent at level 2. (Other character classes pick only one Talent at level 1).

## Dabster

Thief, diplomat, healer, scholar, explorer, artisan can be enacted by a character with the expert class.

Dabsters gain the widest variety of non-combat skills and are the quickest to learn more of them.

### Ability: Skilled

Once per scene, the `Dabster` may reroll any non-combat skill check as an Instant action.

In cases where it matters, the better of the two rolls may be used.

### Ability: Quick Learner

Upon advancing in experience level, the Dabster gains a bonus skill point that can be used on any non-combat, non-magic skill. This point can be saved for later use.

## Caster

Casters can weave the threads of the source. That gift grew in them since childhood, they learned how to hide it and how to use it without getting noticed.

### Ability: Sneak And Convince

The Caster gains one level in Sneak and one in Convince.

But remember, no novice character skill level can exceed 1.

### Ability: Spellcasting

The Caster gains one level in Cast.

See the magic section for weaver and spellcasting.

## Mixing two core classes

Fighter, Dabster, and Caster are meant to cover a wide range of characters, but sometimes more granularity is required. An Adventurer is a mix of two classes, not as strong as a "pure" class, but more versatile.



| Lvl | HP      | Atk | Talent Levels                 |
|:---:|:-------:|:---:|:-----------------------------:|
|   1 |   1d6+1 |  +1 | 1 Dabster + 1 Fighter + 1 Any |

|  10 | 10d6+10 |  +7 | +1 Any                        |

## Dabster-Fighter

A partial Dabster has the _quick learner_ class ability but not the _expertise_ one.

A partial Fighter doesn't have the _fighter's luck_ class ability but still receives their extra Talent.

A partial Dabster / partial Fighter attack bonuses progress less advantageously than for a pure Fighter, but the hit points progress is equivalent.

|  10 | 10d6 |  +5 | +1 Any            |

## Dabster-Caster

A partial Dabster has the _quick learner_ class ability but not the _expertise_ one.

A partial Caster must choose between Sneak or Convince, they cannot benefit from both like a pure Caster does. Furthermore, a partial Caster disposes of less weave points, thus can cast less spells.

## Fighter-Caster

A partial Caster must choose between Sneak or Convince, they cannot benefit from both like a pure Caster does. Furthermore, a partial Caster disposes of less weave points, thus can cast less spells.

A partial Fighter doesn't have the _fighter's luck_ class ability but still receives their extra Talent.
