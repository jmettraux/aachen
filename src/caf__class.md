## Fighter

People gifted for physical violence and tenacity. Or simply any free man.

### Class Ability: Fighter's Luck

Once per scene, as an instant action, a successful attack roll against the character can be negated or the Fighter missed attack roll can be made into a successful hit.

This ability cannot be used to negate environmental damage or damage done to a vehicule or mount the Fighter is riding.

### Class Ability: Extra Talent

A Fighter can pick two Talents at level 1, or pick one Talent at level 2. (Other character classes pick only one Talent at level 1).

## Dabster

Thief, diplomat, healer, scholar, explorer, artisan can be enacted by a character with the expert class.

Dabsters gain the widest variety of non-combat skills and are the quickest to learn more of them.

### Class Ability: Skilled

Once per scene, the `Dabster` may reroll any non-combat skill check as an Instant action.

In cases where it matters, the better of the two rolls may be used.

### Class Ability: Quick Learner

Upon advancing in experience level, the Dabster gains a bonus skill point that can be used on any non-combat, non-magic skill. This point can be saved for later use.

## Caster

Casters can weave the threads of the source. That gift grew in them since childhood, they learned how to hide it and how to use it without getting noticed.

### Class Ability: Sneak And Convince

The Caster gains one level in Sneak and one in Convince.

But remember, no novice character skill level can exceed 1.

### Class Ability: Spellcasting

The Caster gains one level in Cast.

See the magic section for weaver and spellcasting.

## Adventurer

Fighter, Dabster, and Caster are meant to cover a wide range of characters, but sometimes more granularity is required. An Adventurer is a mix of two classes, not as strong as a "pure" class, but more versatile.



| Lvl | HP      | Atk | Talent Picks                  |
|:---:|--------:|:---:|:-----------------------------:|
|   1 |   1d6+2 |  +1 | 1 Dabster + 1 Fighter + 1 Any |

|   3 |   3d6+6 |  +2 |                               |

|   6 |  6d6+12 |  +5 |                               |

|   8 |  8d6+16 |  +6 |                               |
|   9 |  9d6+18 |  +6 |                               |
|  10 | 10d6+20 |  +7 | +1 Any                        |

## Dabster-Fighter

A partial Dabster has the _quick learner_ class ability but not the _expertise_ one.

A partial Fighter doesn't have the _fighter's luck_ class ability but still receives their extra Talent.

A partial Dabster / partial Fighter attack bonuses progress less advantageously than for a pure Fighter, but the hit points progress is equivalent.

|:---:|-----:|:---:|:-----------------:|
|   1 |  1d6 |  +0 | 1 Dabster + 1 Any |
|   2 |  2d6 |  +1 | +1 Any            |
|   3 |  3d6 |  +1 |                   |
|   4 |  4d6 |  +2 |                   |
|   5 |  5d6 |  +2 | +1 Any            |
|   6 |  6d6 |  +3 |                   |
|   7 |  7d6 |  +3 | +1 Any            |
|   8 |  8d6 |  +4 |                   |
|   9 |  9d6 |  +4 |                   |
|  10 | 10d6 |  +5 | +1 Any            |

## Dabster-Caster

A partial Dabster has the _quick learner_ class ability but not the _expertise_ one.

A partial Caster must choose between Sneak or Convince, they cannot benefit from both like a pure Caster does. Furthermore, a partial Caster disposes of less weave points, thus can cast less spells.
