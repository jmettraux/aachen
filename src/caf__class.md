# Select Class

There are only three core classes, `Fighter`, `Dabster`, and `Caster`, but they can be mixed in pairs (three plus three classes in total).

Each class has its own Hit Points and Attack Bonus progression as character level increases. A class is also given two class talents and one free talent to select (two free talents for a `Dabster`).

Adventurers are probably travellers, pilgrims, traders, vagabonds, gyrovagues, or hired hands on a mission. One who wields a spear is probably a fighter, you'd have to see them fight to ascertain that, the man with a tonsure is a cleric, or someone posing as one.

There should probably be no more than one `Caster` per adventurer group. It's a difficult class to play, it's weaker and must hide its abilities constantly from others.

A party composed only of `Fighter` characters is acceptable, but having one or two `Dabster` characters is probably better.

The number of classes is limited, but not your imagination, and experience will forge the characters gradually.

## Fighter

Any free man is supposed to bear arms in service of his community. Better if he has some actual training in using them.

Choosing the `Fighter` class doesn't mean the character is a professional soldier, it means they have an aptitude for weapons and are devoting time to maintain and enhance that aptitude.

The `Fighter` class talents are `VERY SWERVING` and `VERY FIRM`.

<!--
### ❦ Swerving

Once per scene, as an instant action, a successful attack roll against the character can be negated or the character missed attack roll can be made to hit.

This ability cannot be used to negate an attack targetting a vehicle or creature the character is riding. It cannot be used to negate damage inflicted by the "environment" the character is in.
-->
<!--
 All heroes can pick one Focus, but Warriors may pick two, either taking two different Foci at first level or taking two
levels of a single favored art.

A Fighter can pick two Talents at level 1, or pick one Talent at level 2. (Other character classes pick only one Talent at level 1).

## Dabster

One who is skilled, proficient. Thief, diplomat, healer, scholar, explorer, priest, artisan, ...

Dabsters gain the widest variety of non-combat skills and are the quickest to learn more of them.

The `Dabster` class talents are `VERY SKILLFUL` and `VERY EVASIVE`.

<!--
### ❦ Assimilating

Upon advancing in experience level, the Dabster gains a bonus skill point that can be used on any non-combat, non-magic skill. This point can be saved for later use.

See the section on _Advancement_ for how it plays out.

## Caster

At some point during their childhood, the `Caster`'s gift was revealed and they understood they were different and had to conceal that difference.

Some of them are very talented, some others less so but were lucky enough to find someone whose trail they could walk in.

A `Caster` has `VERY INTRICATE` and `VERY WISE` as class talents.

The ~~factor~~ for computing the weave points (WP) of a `Caster` is the best of the `INT`, `WIS`, or `CHA` modifier.


## Mixing two classes

Fighter, Dabster, and Caster are meant to cover a wide range of characters, but sometimes more granularity is required. An Adventurer is a mix of two classes, not as strong as a "pure" class, but more versatile.

## Fighter-Dabster _or_ Fighter-Caster

Those two mixes grant more hit points and better attacks.

The ~~factor~~ for computing the weave points (WP) of a `Fighter-Caster` character is the `WIS` modifier.

## Dabster-Caster

This mix grants one more talent at character creation. It gives the hit points and the attack bonuses of the Dabster.

The ~~factor~~ for computing the weave points (WP) of the character is the `INT` modifier.
