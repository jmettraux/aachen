# Casting

Casters have the gift of weaving magical threads to achieve effects. The gift doesn't seem hereditary, a minority of people are casters, some of them don't even know they have the gift, some might be blind, weaving but not seeing the threads. Casters normally see the threads they weave but don't see other casters' threads, unless a thread revealing spell is used.

Most non-casters think magic exists, but they don't know what forms it takes. Some of them know of the gift.


## Casting a spell

Select
: The player selects a spell (~~Skill~~ × ~~Colour~~ × ~~Form~~) and negotiate the effect with the referee.


Invest
: Casting a spell costs a main action and at least 1 CP;
: Spells scale with the CPs invested in them;
: Casters may not invest more CPs than their current CP count.

Roll
: 1d20 + _Magic Skill_ ≥ _Caster TC_; or
: 1d20 + _Magic Skill_ ≥ _Target DC_;
: Casters who incur damage in the combat round right before casting roll with disadvantage;
: Casters may invest extra CPs to increase their roll result, +1 per CP;
: If the roll fails, the spell peters out;
: Success or failure, invested CPs are consumed and gone.

End
: Casters who converted all their HPs to CPs to cast fall inconscious right after the the cast, successful or not.


## Casting Points

Rest
: After a good night rest, casters go back to their Cast Point maximum (CP max);
: After a not so good night rest, it's half the CP max rounded up.

Max
: Casters may temporarily accumulate more CP than their CP max.

from HPs
: As an instant action, casters may convert one or more of their HPs to CPs.

from ELs
: As an instant action, casters may incur one Exhaustion Level to gain 2d4 CPs.

from CON
: As an instant action, casters may turn 1 `CON` point into 2d8 CPs.


<!-- RETURN -->

TODO Exhaustion level for 1d8 CPs

Casting at ~~Risk~~
: Casters may accept a risk in order to gain 1 extra CP to invest;
: Still, at least 1 CP must be invested;
: If the casting roll fails with a 1, the spell peters out as expected, the CPs are consumed, but 1d6 extra HPs have to be paid;
: Friends and/or foes within 5ft must bear the extra HP cost;
: The caster must endure at least 1 of the extra HPs (they may pay in CP though).
