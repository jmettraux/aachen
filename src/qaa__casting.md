# Spellcasting

<!--
Weavers are persons with the gift of weaving, weaving magical threads to achieve effects.

The gift doesn't seem hereditary. The majority of the weavers consider it a curse rather than a gift and hide it. A minority of people are weavers. Some weavers don't even know they have the gift, they might be gifted but blind, they don't see the threads although they trigger the weaving.

Some non-gifted people, through their friendship with a weaver know of the gift. They keep the secret for fear of their friend to be discovered. Some non-weavers abuse weak weavers and use them but keep the silence.

A weaver sees the thread they weave. Non-weavers don't seem to see threads, although some might... A weaver doesn't see the threads another weaver makes, unless they use a thread-revealing spell.

Colours are known to many cultures. Different spells have different thread colours. It seems that the black threads are about pain and damage for all the weavers, and that blue threads generate cold or nullify heat were they appear, these are two examples.

Weavers seem to agree on colours, but there may be some of them with twisted perception of the colours (as written above, some are even blind to the threads).

Balls, arrows, huts are known to many cultures. A simple vocabulary emerged around forms and colours, they easily translate from a language to the other. Weaver may thus easily describe what they are trying to achieve to each other.

Some travelled weavers say that in Constantinople or in the Caliphate, there are more colours and more forms and sophistication, but it'd take a lifetime to ascertain.

Weaver casts spells by consuming Weave Points (hereafter WP or WPs).

After a good night rest, a Weaver disposes of their level plus their level times the best of their INT, WIS, or CHA modifier. Thus a level 2 Weaver with +2 in INT, disposes of 2 + 2 * 2 = 6 WP.

## casting cost in WPs

Casting a spell costs at least 1 WP. The Weaver decides how many WPs they use right before casting. The Weaver cannot go below zero WPs.

A weaver can, as an instant action, convert some of his HPs to WPs. The weaver must "spare" at least 1 HP.

Once the WP are consumed, a skill check against a difficulty of 8 has to be rolled 2d6 + Magic skill + attribute modifier.

The attribute modifier is either INT, WIS, or CHA, the Weaver decides which one to use, guided by the referee. In a given scene, the same modifier cannot be used twice in a row. For example, a Weaver cannot cast a spell with an INT modifier and then another (or the same spell) with an INT modifier, they must use the WIS or the CHA modifier.

The Weaver (or the referee) are invited to "roleplay" the spell depending on the att modifier used. INT cold logic, WIS street smart, CHA force of will.

If the roll fails, the weavery fails, the WP are consumed anyway.

## becoming frail to obtain WPs

A Weaver may accept become "frail" (see Injury) and immediately gain 1d6 WP plus the best of its INT, CHA, or WIS modifiers.

## casting at risk

A Weaver may accept a risk to reduce by one the WP cost of casting a spell. The minimal cost is still 1 WP. If the skill check results in a double 1, the cast fails, and 1d6 HPs have to paid by the caster or creatures within 5 feet. The referee determines who bears the extra cost and by how much. The caster must pay at least 1 HP or 1 WP, other designated targets must pay in HPs.

## known spells

A Weaver is usually granted 1 or 2 spells at level 1. As the Weaver gains experience, the referee considers their trail and hint at new spells. The referee may "loan" spells to the Weaver and eventually take them back. Two spells per level might be a good number for the known spells.
