# Spellcasting

Casters have the gift of weaving magical threads to achieve effects. The gift doesn't seem hereditary, a minority of people are casters, some of them don't even know they have the gift, some might be blind, weaving but not seeing the threads. Casters normally see the threads they weave but don't see other casters' threads, unless a thread revealing spell is used.

Most non-casters think magic exists, but they don't know what forms it takes. Some of them know of the gift.

Casting Points[^1]
: After a good night rest, casters go back to their Cast Point maximum (CP max);
: After a not so good night rest, casters go back to half the CP max rounded up;
: Casters may temporarily accumulate more CP than their CP max;
: As an instant action, casters may at any moment convert one or more of their remaining HPs to CPs;
: As an instant action, casters may accept becoming ~~frail~~ (see Health) to gain _character level_ Ã— d4 CPs.

Casting Cost
: Casting a spell costs a main action and at least 1 CP;
: Spells scale with the CPs invested in them;
: Casters may not invest more CPs than their current CP count.

Casting Roll[^2]
: _attribute modifier_ is `INT`m (book smart), `WIS`m (street smart), or `CHA`m (force of will);
: The same _att modifier_ cannot be used twice in a row in the same scene;
: 2d6 + `Cast` + _att modifier_ >= 8 to succeed;
: Casters who incur damage in the combat round before casting do roll at disadvantage (3d6, 2 worse dice);
: If the roll fails, the spell peters out;
: Success or failure, invested CPs are consumed and gone.

Casting at ~~Risk~~
: Casters may accept a risk in order to gain 1 extra CP to invest;
: Still, at least 1 CP must be invested;
: If the casting roll fails with a double 1, the spell peters out as expected, the CPs are consumed, but 1d6 extra HPs have to be paid;
: Friends and/or foes within 5ft must bear the extra HP cost;
: The caster must endure at least 1 of the extra HP (they may pay in CP though).

After Cast
: Casters who converted all their HPs to CPs to cast fall inconscious right after the the cast, successful or not.

[^1]:
  Using two sort of coins for HPs and CPs make point management easy and tactile.

[^2]:
  Maybe the referee will want to simplify things and let casters use the same modifier over and over.

## known spells

A Weaver is usually granted 1 or 2 spells at level 1. As the Weaver gains experience, the referee considers their trail and hint at new spells. The referee may "loan" spells to the Weaver and eventually take them back. Two spells per level might be a good number for the known spells.
