# durations, scenes, rounds, and exploration turns

The referee is expected to track time for adventures and campaigns. Faery tales of endless winters have been told and retold but they too have some kind of calendar that the referee must track.

TODO the players help harvest for five days, track that
TODO the players rest for two weeks, track that

At a finer level of granularity, keeping track of how much time is required to perform tasks and how long do effects, magical or other, do last is necessary.

Most effects do last for a **scene**. A single fight is a scene, a dialog with a NPC is a scene. A single time span in a single location. The majority of scenes last no longer than a quarter of an hour. When an power or ability listed as "lasting for a scene" is used in one scene, it's expected to be over at the beginning of the next scene, unless decided otherwise by the referee.

During a fight (scene), the time is divided in **rounds** of six seconds.

TODO continue me, turn?

An **exploration turn** is used when exploring sites and ruins. One exploration turn lasts ten minutes. It's used for encounter frequency, rest requirement, and resource management, for example, a torch lasts for three exploration turns.
