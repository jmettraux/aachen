# Select an Extra Skill

Learn a new skill (starting at +0) or increase an already known skill (max +2, since character level + 1).

Magical skills are off limits for non `Caster` characters.


# Determine Hit Points

The class table determine the hit points for the character. For example, a `Fighter` starts with 1d8+3 HPs. The player is granted a `CON TC` roll, if they succeed the HP roll is done with advantage, thus a fighter with a successful roll would then roll 2d8, pick the best and add 3 to determine their starting HPs.

[^1]:
  Option:

  a level 1 character gets the best possible roll, the example `Fighter` thus gets 11 HPs


# Determine Cast Points

Everyone has Hit Points, but `Casters` have Cast Points (CPs) too. They can be thought of as mana points. They are consumed when casting spells and are acquired back through rest or through draining.

The class tables determines how many CPs a character starts with. For example a `Dabster-Caster` rolls 1d6. Players first roll 1d20 against their `MEN TC` (mental save TC), if they succeed, the CP count is determined by rolling two dices and picking the best, so a successful `Dabster-Caster` would roll 2d6 and pick the best.


# Select Spells

~~FIXME~~

A `Caster` or simply a character with the `Intricate` trait may select a few spells in accord with the referee. The background and the origin of the character might lead the referee to recommend certain spells.

A level 1 character knows (1 + `INT`m) spells (at least one). The referee is free to grant an extra known spell of choice.
