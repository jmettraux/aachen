: Affects armour class, ranged and light weapon attack rolls and damage rolls.

Constitution CON
: Hardiness, enduring injury, resisting poisons, going without food or rest.
: Affects the maximum hit points.

Intelligence INT
: Memory, reasoning, intellectual skills, general education. Book smart.

Wisdom WIS
: Noticing things, making judgements, reading situations, intuition. Street smart.

Charisma CHA
: Force of character, charming others, attracting attention, winning loyalty.
: Affects reaction rolls.

## Roll Attributes [^1]

To generate a character's score, roll 3d6 six times, assigning them in order to STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, and CHA. If desired, the lowest roll can be replaced by a 14.

[^1]:

  **Option**: The referee may allow the rolled score to be placed in any attribute.

  **Option**: Instead of rolling, one may use the 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, and 7 array.


## Write Down Attribute Modifiers

| Attribute | Modifier | {.half-left.compact}
|:---------:|:--------:|
|         3 |       -2 |
|     4 - 7 |       -1 |
|    8 - 13 |        0 |
|   14 - 17 |       +1 |
|        18 |       +2 |

For each score write down next to it its modifier.

When rolling dice that are affected by an attribute, one doesn't apply the whole score; instead the attribute modifier is applied.
