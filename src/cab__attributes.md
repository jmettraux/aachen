## Roll Attributes

To generate a character's score, roll 3d6 six times, assigning them in order to STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, and CHA.

**Option**: The referee may allow the rolled score to be placed in any attribute.

**Option**: Instead of rolling, one may use the 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, and 7 array.

Any of the attribute score may be replaced by a 14, unless the array method was used.

## Write Down Attribute Modifiers

For each score write down next to it its modifier.

When rolling dice that are affected by an attribute, one doesn't apply the whole score; instead the attribute modifier is applied.

| Attribute | Modifier | {#table-id .bar.baz}
|-----------|----------|
|         3 |       -2 |
|     4 - 7 |       -1 |
|    8 - 13 |        0 |
|   14 - 17 |       +1 |
|        18 |       +2 |
